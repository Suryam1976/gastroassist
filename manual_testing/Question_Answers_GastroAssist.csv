4," In a patient with elevated liver enzymes, how would you differentiate between hepatocellular and cholestatic injury?","Hepatocellular injury shows elevated ALT/AST, while cholestatic injury shows elevated ALP and GGT. The ALT:ALP ratio helps in differentiation."

10,"In a patient with Barrett’s esophagus, what is the standard surveillance recommendation?", Endoscopic surveillance every 3–5 years for non-dysplastic Barrett’s; more frequently if dysplasia is present.
