      "answer": "Based on the information I found:\n\n- Epigastric abdominal pain that improves with meals is the hallmark of PUD. However, in some cases, symptoms of PUD may worsen with meals. NSAID use is associated with the development of PUD. Hematemesis, if present, suggests more complicated disease including bleeding ulcer and warrants urgent GI referral and endoscopy.\n\n- It has many causes, including overeating, lactose intolerance, and underlying conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammation, and infection. Heartburn is a symptom of acid reflux and GERD, commonly described as a burning feeling in your chest after you eat. However, they may lead to acid reflux or GERD, which can cause epigastric pain or heartburn. This condition may result from acid reflux, which can cause epigastric pain.

A negative result suggests a low likelihood of celiac disease.\n\n- Positive Test Result. A positive tTG IgA blood test result means that the immune system has produced antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, suggesting an immune response to gluten. This strongly indicates the presence of celiac disease. However, a positive result is typically followed by an intestinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n- The EMA-IgA test has a sensitivity of 86-100% and a specificity of 97-100%.
