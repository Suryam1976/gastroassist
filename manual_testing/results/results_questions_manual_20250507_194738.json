Causes range from acute digestive issues like acid reflux to chronic conditions such as esophagitis.\nEpigastric pain is a term to describe discomfort or aching that occurs beneath your rib cage in your upper abdominal region.\nIt has many causes, including overeating, lactose intolerance, and underlying conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammation, and infection.\nKnowing what’s causing your epigastric pain is important so you can work with a doctor to treat it.\nKeep reading to learn more about what may be causing your symptoms.\nWhat causes epigastric pain?\n\nPotential causes of epigastric pain include:\n1. Acid reflux and heartburn\nAcid reflux is when some of the acid or food in your stomach washes back up into your esophagus. If you experience frequent acid reflux, you may have a condition known as GERD.\nHeartburn is a symptom of acid reflux and GERD, commonly described as a burning feeling in your chest after you eat. This feeling is usually worse when you lie or bend down due to the position of your esophagus.\n2. Lactose intolerance\nLactose intolerance happens when your body has trouble digesting dairy products, such as milk or cheese. Typically, symptoms will occur every time you eat dairy.\nDairy products contain a type of sugar called lactose. Lactose intolerance often develops when you don’t have enough lactase enzyme. This enzyme is important in breaking down lactose. Learn more about the symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nAlthough lactose intolerance may cause epigastric pain, it’s usually felt lower down in the abdominal area.\n3. Overeating\nWhen you eat too much in one go, your stomach can expand beyond its usual size. This puts a lot of pressure on the organs around it. This pressure can cause pain in your gut and lead to indigestion (dyspepsia).\nSymptoms may include heartburn due to stomach acid and contents returning to your esophagus.\n4. Hiatal hernia\nA hiatal hernia happens when part of your stomach gets pushed up toward your diaphragm through the hole that the esophagus passes through, which is called the hiatus.\nHiatal hernias don’t always cause pain or discomfort. However, they may lead to acid reflux or GERD, which can cause epigastric pain or heartburn.\nLearn more about the symptoms of a hiatal hernia.\n5. Esophagitis\nEsophagitis occurs when the lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed.\nCommon causes include:\n\nacid coming back up from your stomach\nallergies\ninfection\nchronic irritation from medications\n\nRead about the symptoms of esophagitis.\n6. Gastritis\nGastritis happens when the lining of your stomach (mucosa) becomes inflamed. This may be due to a bacterial infection, an immune system disorder, or ongoing damage to your stomach.\nIt can be acute, last briefly, or chronic, lasting for years or more if left untreated.\nLearn more about the symptoms of gastritis.\n7. Peptic ulcer disease\nPeptic ulcer disease happens when the lining of your stomach or small intestine gets damaged a bacterial infection or by certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nLearn about other symptoms of peptic ulcer disease.\n8. Barrett’s esophagus\nBarrett’s esophagus occurs when the tissue that lines your esophagus becomes more like the tissue lining your intestines. This is known as intestinal metaplasia.\nThis condition may result from acid reflux, which can cause epigastric pain. However, not everyone with Barrett’s esophagus will have acid reflux.\nIf you develop this condition, you’ll need to work closely with your doctor to manage symptoms. Untreated Barrett’s esophagus can increase your chances of cancer of the esophagus.\nLearn more about Barrett’s esophagus.\n9. Gallbladder inflammation or gallstones\nYour gallbladder can become inflamed when gallstones block the opening of this organ. The condition is known as cholecystitis.\nThis can be painful and may require hospitalization or surgery.\nRead more about symptoms of gallbladder inflammation.\n10. Epigastric pain in pregnancy\nMild epigastric pain is common while you’re pregnant due to the pressure on your abdominal area, as well as changes in your hormones, affecting digestion.\nHowever, significant epigastric pain in pregnancy is sometimes a symptom of a serious condition known as preeclampsia. You’ll want to work closely with your doctor, as this can become life threatening if severe.\nLearn more about the symptoms of preeclampsia.\n11. Coronary artery disease\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), also called ischemic heart disease, can present with what may feel like gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain. This is particularly common in women.\nIf you have concerns that this may be the cause, it’s important to seek advice from a doctor.\nRead about additional symptoms of coronary artery disease.\n12. Enlarged spleen\nThe spleen is a vital part of your immune system, located on the left side of your body beneath the rib cage. Various conditions or diseases can lead to an enlarged spleen.\nIf it isn’t treated promptly, it can rupture, which can be life threatening.\nNot everyone with an enlarged spleen will experience symptoms, but it can feel like a pain in the abdomen where the spleen is located.\nLearn more about an enlarged spleen.\nHow do you get rid of upper epigastric pain?\n\nTreatment for epigastric pain depends on the cause. If your pain is from your diet or overeating, your doctor may recommend changing your eating habits or lifestyle. This may include taking regular exercise and eating nutrient-dense foods that don’t upset your stomach.\nIf the pain is from certain medications, such as NSAIDs, your doctor may help you find another way to manage your pain. They may also suggest antacids or acid-blocking medications to relieve your symptoms.\nIf an underlying condition such as GERD, Barrett’s esophagus, or peptic ulcer disease is causing your epigastric pain, you’ll likely require acid-blocking medications. You may also require antibiotics if a bacterial infection is involved (for example, if your ulcer disease is due to H. pylori).\nWhen to contact a doctor\n\nReach out to your doctor immediately if your epigastric pain is severe, ongoing, or interfering with your daily life.\nSince there are life threatening conditions that can present with epigastric pain, such as CAD, it’s important you go to the emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\ntrouble breathing or swallowing\nthrowing up blood\nblood in your stool or black, tarry stool\nhigh fever\nchest pain\ndifficulty breathing\npassing out\n\nYou should also contact your doctor if your symptoms do not improve with over-the-counter or home treatments and have lasted more than a few days.\nTakeaway\n\nEpigastric pain is a term used to describe pain or discomfort located beneath the ribcage in your upper abdomen. It can have various causes, many associated with the digestive system.\nEpigastric pain has a range of causes, some more severe than others. If your symptoms do not improve or you experience severe symptoms, contact a healthcare professional to find out the cause.\nContacting your doctor as soon as you notice persistent epigastric pain can help you find relief for your symptoms.\nHow we reviewed this article:\nSources\nHistory\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

To lower the risk of ulcers associated with long-term NSAID use, clinicians should consider coadministering a PPI or substituting an NSAID with less effect on gastric mucosa, such as celecoxib. Potential risks of long-term PPI use include fractures, interaction with antiplatelet medications, chronic kidney disease, Clostridioides difficile infection, dementia, and magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 micronutrient deficiencies.

Although PPIs, H2 blockers, sucralfate, and misoprostol can all be considered to treat NSAID-associated PUD, PPIs are far more effective than other agents.25 Sucralfate is effective for treating NSAID-associated duodenal ulcers but not for the treatment or prevention of NSAID-associated gastric ulcers. pylori infections, as well as increased accessibility to anti-secretory therapy and more judicious use of NSAIDs. However, due to its continued high lifetime prevalence and varied clinical presentation, recognition and appropriate management of PUD are key to avoid and minimize significant complications.",

How can I expand my search?\n\nOn the abstract page for a citation, see the Similar Articles section for a pre-calculated set of additional PubMed citations closely related to that article.\nRemove extraneous or specific terms from the search box.\nTry using alternative terms to describe the concepts you are searching.\n\nFind a specific citation\nPaste the article title into the search box, or enter citation details such as the author, journal name and the year the article was published in the search box and the PubMed citation sensor will automatically analyze your query for citation information to return the correct citation. The citation sensor incorporates a fuzzy matching algorithm and will retrieve the best match even if a search includes an incorrect term. You do not need to use field tags or Boolean operators.\nSearching by author\nEnter the author’s last name and initials without punctuation in the search box, and click Search.\nIf you only know the author’s last name, use the author search field tag [au], e.g., brody[au].\nNames entered using either the lastname+initials format (e.g., smith ja) or the full name format (john a smith) and no search tag are searched as authors as well as collaborators, if they exist in PubMed.\nEnter a full author name in natural or inverted order, e.g., julia s wong or wong julia s.\n\nPrior to 2002, full author names were not included on PubMed citations, so full author name searches will only retrieve citations from 2002 forward, when the full author name was published in the article. \nA comma following the last name for searching is optional. For some names, however, it is necessary to distinguish which name is the last name by using the comma following the last name, e.g., james, ryan.\n\nOmit periods after initials and put all suffixes at the end, e.g., vollmer charles jr\nInitials and suffixes are not required. If you include a middle initial or suffix, you will only retrieve citations for articles that were published using the middle initial or suffix.\nMore information about author searching:\n\nTo search by author using the search builder, click Advanced search and then select Author from the All Fields menu. The author search box includes an autocomplete feature.\nYou may click an author link on the abstract display to execute a search for the author in PubMed. Results will display using a ranking algorithm if the author name is computationally similar for additional PubMed citations.\nIf an author name includes only stopwords, use the author search field tag [au] to search in combination with other terms, e.g., just by[au] seizure.\nAuthor names are automatically truncated to account for varying initials and designations such as Jr. To turn off the truncation, use double quotes around the author's name with the author search field tag [au], e.g., \"smith j\"[au].\nUse the search field tag [1au] to search for the first personal author or [lastau] to search for the last personal author name in a citation.\n\nFor additional information on author names in PubMed, please see the journal article, \"Author Name Disambiguation for PubMed.\"\nSearching by journal\nEnter one of the following in the search box:\n\nfull journal title (e.g., molecular biology of the cell)\ntitle abbreviation (e.g., mol biol cell)\nISSN number, a standardized international code (e.g., 1059-1524)\n\nMore information about journal searching:\n\nTo search by journal using the search builder, click Advanced search and then select Journal from the All Fields menu. The journal search box includes an autocomplete feature.\nTo find full journal names, use the NLM Catalog, or mouseover the journal title abbreviation on the citation (available in abstract view).\nClick Journals in NCBI Databases on the PubMed homepage.\nEnter the journal name and click Search.\n\n\nUse the journal search field tag [ta] to limit your search to the journal only, e.g., gene therapy[ta], scanning[ta]\nSearching with the full journal title or abbreviation is recommended for complete retrieval of indexed items; older citations may not have an ISSN.\nIf a journal title or abbreviation includes a special character (e.g., parentheses, brackets, &), enter the title or abbreviation without the special characters. For example, to search by the journal abbreviation j hand surg [am], enter j hand surg am.\nSearching for a journal will automatically map to the official journal title and the title associated with an alternative title, if one exists. To turn off this automatic mapping enter the journal in double quotes and tag with [ta], e.g., \"science\"[ta].\n\nA list of journals included in PubMed is available by FTP.\nSearching by date\n\nUsing the results timeline\nUsing the search builder\nSearching by a single date in the search box\nSearching for a date range in the search box\nSearching for a relative date range\n\nUsing the results timeline\nClick and drag the sliders on the Publication Date timeline to change the date range for your search.\nNote: The Publication Date timeline counts all publication dates for a citation as supplied by the publisher, e.g., print and electronic publication dates. These dates may span more than one year; for example, an article that was published online in November 2018 and published in a print issue in January 2019. This means the sum of results represented in the timeline may differ from the search results count.\nUsing the search builder\n\nClick Advanced search and use the search builder.\nSelect a date field from the All Fields menu, e.g., Date – Publication, and enter a single date or a date range in the fill-in-the-blank boxes. Month and day are optional. If you want to search for a date range up to the current date, do not edit the ‘Present’ date box.\nAdd the date from the builder to the query box.\nOnce you have finished adding terms to the query box, click Search (or Add to History) to run the search.\n\nSearching by a single date in the search box\nEnter dates using the format yyyy/mm/dd [date field]. The month and day are optional.\nUse a Boolean operator when combining a date with other search terms.\nExample\nUse the Boolean operator AND to limit your search to a specific publication date.\ncancer AND 2020/06/01[dp]\nThe available date fields are:\n\nDate of Publication [dp] - Date searching includes both print and electronic dates of publication. Searching for a single date does not include items when the electronic date of publication is after the print date.\nElectronic Date of Publication (if applicable) [epdat]\nPrint Date of Publication (if applicable) [ppdat]\nEntry Date [edat] - Date used for PubMed processing, such as “Most Recent” sort order.\nMeSH Date [mhda] - The date the citation was indexed with MeSH terms.\nCreate Date [crdt] - The date the PubMed record was first created.\n\nSearching for a date range in the search box\nEnter date ranges using a colon (:) between each date followed by a [date field].\nUse a Boolean operator when combining a date range with other search terms.\nExample\nUse the Boolean operator AND to limit your search to a date range.\nheart disease AND 2019/01/01:2019/12/01[dp]\nComprehensive searches for a full year should be entered as 2000:2000[dp] rather than 2000[dp] to retrieve citations with a different print and electronic year of publication.\nDate range searching includes both print and electronic dates of publication.\nSearching for a relative date range\nUse the following format to search for a relative date range:\n\nterm=\"last X days\"[date field]\nterm=\"last X months\"[date field]\nterm=\"last X years\"[date field]\n\nwhere X is the number of days, months or years immediately preceding today’s date and [date field] is the date field tag: [dp], [edat] or [crdt].\nThe relative date range search for publication dates will also include citations with publication dates after today's date; therefore, citations with publication dates in the future will be included in the results.\nFilters\nYou can use filters to narrow your search results by publication date, text availability, article attribute, article type, article language, species, sex, age, and other.\nTo apply a filter:\n\nRun a search in PubMed.\nClick the filter you would like to activate from the sidebar. A check mark will appear next to the activated filter(s). \nSubsequent searches will be filtered until the selected filters are turned off, or until your browser data is cleared.\nA green \"Filters applied\" message will display at the top of the results page when filters are applied to your search.\n\nThe most frequently used filters appear on the sidebar by default. More filters are available for some categories:\n\nClick the \"See all … filters\" link for a filter category.\nA pop-up menu will appear showing all available filters for that category.\nSelect the filter(s) you would like to apply to your search.\nTo cancel your selections, click Cancel or click on the X in the upper right corner to close the pop-up and return to your search results.\n\n\nClick Apply. This will close the pop-up menu, apply the selected filter(s) to your search, and display your selection(s) on the sidebar.\nThe selected filter(s) will appear on the sidebar in addition to the default filters until your browser cookies are cleared, or you click the \"Reset filters display\" button at the bottom of the sidebar.\n\n\n\nClearing applied filters:\n\nTo turn off all currently applied filters, click the \"Clear filters\" link in the green \"Filters applied\" message at the top of the page, or click the \"Clear all filters\" button at the bottom of the sidebar.\nTo turn off individual filters, click the filter on the sidebar.\nTo reset the filters shown on the sidebar to the default filter list, click the \"Reset filters display\" button at the bottom of the sidebar. This will also clear any currently applied filters.\n\nMore information about filters:\n\nMany filters under the Additional Filters section limit your search results to citations that have been assigned specific MeSH terms during MEDLINE indexing. This means these filters may exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms.\nSee Filter search strategies for the equivalent PubMed query for each filter.\nYou can activate additional filters with My Custom filters. Once activated, these filters will appear at the top of your sidebar under \"My Custom Filters\".\n\nPublication date filters\nTo filter your results by Publication Date, click 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, or enter a custom range. These filters include both electronic and print publication dates.\nText availability filters\nTo filter your results to only citations that include a link to full text, a link to free full text, or an abstract, click the appropriate selections.\nAlternatively, you may search for citations with links to full text, free full text or include an abstract using the values: full text[sb], free full text[sb], or 'hasabstract'. No search field tag is required for hasabstract. You may also search for all citations with a structured abstract with ‘hasstructuredabstract’.\nNote: Most citations in PubMed to articles published before 1975 do not include abstracts.\nArticle attribute filter\nUse the associated data filter to find citations that include secondary source databanks and accession numbers. These data links connect to records in other NLM databases (for example: GenBank, ClinicalTrials.gov) or external data repositories (for example: figshare, Dryad). Data links are provided by the publisher and/or by data repositories through participation in NCBI’s LinkOut service.\nArticle type filters\nUse article type filters to narrow your results based on the content or style of the article, such as: Clinical Trial or Review. Article types are also called publication types.\nYou can add more article type filters to the sidebar using the \"See all article type filters\" link. The complete list of publication types found in PubMed is available.\nArticle type filters rely on citations' Publication Type [pt] data except for the Systematic Review filter, which uses a search strategy in addition to the publication type.\nPublication type data may be supplied by the publisher or assigned during the MEDLINE indexing process. Therefore, these filters may exclude some citations that have not yet completed the MEDLINE indexing process.\nSystematic reviews\nTo search for systematic reviews in PubMed, use the Systematic Review article type filter on the sidebar, or enter your search terms followed by AND systematic[sb] in the search box. For example, lyme disease AND systematic[sb].\nThe Systematic Review filter uses a search strategy in addition to the Systematic Review publication type [pt] to find systematic reviews in PubMed. To limit your search to only those citations with the Systematic Review publication type, use the publication type search tag[pt], i.e., systematic review[pt]; however, this may exclude some relevant citations that have not yet completed the MEDLINE indexing process.\nArticle language filters\nLanguage filters restrict your search to articles published in the selected language(s). You can add more language filters to the sidebar using the \"See all article language filters\" link.\nBy default, PubMed displays English language titles and abstracts when provided by the publisher. Check the Abstract display for links to view the abstract in other languages (when available).\nArticle language filters are located under the Additional Filters section.\nSpecies filters\nSpecies filters restrict your results to human or animal studies:\n\nHumans\nOther Animals\n\nSpecies filters limit your search results to citations that were assigned the associated MeSH terms for species during MEDLINE indexing. These filters will typically deliver precise results but can also exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms on their PubMed record. For example, some citations are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as preprints, Online Ahead of Print citations, and U.S. government-funded research published in journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE.\nSpecies filters are located under the Additional Filters section.\nSex filters\nSex filters restrict your search results to a specific sex for an animal or human study:\n\nFemale\nMale\n\nSex filters limit your search results to citations that were assigned the associated MeSH terms for sex during MEDLINE indexing. These filters will typically deliver precise results but can also exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms on their PubMed record. For example, some citations are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as preprints, Online Ahead of Print citations, and U.S. government-funded research published in journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE.\nSex filters are located under the Additional Filters section.\nAge filters\nAge filters restrict results to a specific age group for a human study.\nAge filters limit your search results to citations that were assigned the associated MeSH terms for age during MEDLINE indexing. These filters will typically deliver precise results but can also exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms on their PubMed record. For example, some citations are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as preprints, Online Ahead of Print citations, and U.S. government-funded research published in journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE.\nAge filters are located under the Additional Filters section. You can add more age filters to the sidebar using the \"See all age filters\" link.\nAge filters include:\n\nChild: birth-18 years\nNewborn: birth-1 month\nInfant: birth-23 months\nInfant: 1-23 months\nPreschool Child: 2-5 years\nChild: 6-12 years\nAdolescent: 13-18 years\nAdult: 19+ years\nYoung Adult: 19-24 years\nAdult: 19-44 years\nMiddle Aged + Aged: 45+ years\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\nAged: 65+ years\n80 and over: 80+ years\n\nOther filters & more subsets\nExclude preprints\nThe Exclude preprints filter will exclude preprint citations from your search results. Alternatively, you can exclude preprints from your search results by including NOT preprint[pt] at the end of your query.\nSee Preprints for more information about preprint citations in PubMed.\nThe Exclude preprints filter is located under the Additional Filters section.\nMEDLINE Subset\nThe MEDLINE filter limits results to citations that are indexed for MEDLINE. To use this filter in a query, add medline[sb] to your search.\nThe MEDLINE filter is located under the Additional Filters section.\nPubMed Central Subset\nTo restrict retrieval to citations that have a free full text article available in PubMed Central (PMC), search \"pubmed pmc\"[sb].\nUse the PMID/PMCID/NIHMSID Converter to convert IDs for publications referenced in PubMed and PMC. To retrieve citations that include an NIHMS ID use the query, hasnihmsid.\nCitation Status Subsets\nThe citation status indicates the internal processing stage of an article in the PubMed database (see PubMed Citation Status Subsets).\nTo search for a particular citation status, enter one of the search terms below followed by the [sb] search tag:\n\npublisher\ninprocess\nmedline\npubmednotmedline\n\nTo search for the total number of PubMed citations, enter all[sb] in the search box.\nAhead of Print Citations\nPublishers may submit citations for articles that appear on the web prior to their publication in final or print format. To search for these ahead-of-print citations, enter pubstatusaheadofprint.\nSearching for a phrase\nMany phrases are recognized by the subject translation table used in PubMed's Automatic Term Mapping (ATM). For example, if you enter fever of unknown origin, PubMed recognizes this phrase as a MeSH Term.\nYou can bypass ATM and search for a specific phrase using the following formats:\n\nEnclose the phrase in double quotes: \"kidney allograft\"\nIf you use quotes and the phrase is not found in the phrase index, the quotes are ignored and the terms are processed using automatic term mapping. The message \"Quoted phrase not found in phrase index\" will display at the top of your search results.\n\n\nUse a search tag: kidney allograft[tw]\nIf you use a search tag and the phrase is not found in the phrase index, the phrase will be broken into separate terms. For example, \"psittacine flight\" is not in the phrase index, so a search for psittacine flight[tw] is broken up and translated as: (((\"psittaciformes\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"psittaciformes\"[All Fields]) OR \"psittacine\"[All Fields]) OR \"psittacines\"[All Fields]) AND \"flight\"[Text Word]\n\n\nUse a hyphen: kidney-allograft\nIf you use a hyphen and the phrase is not found in the phrase index, the search will not return any results for that phrase.\nHyphenated phrases matching a MeSH term or entry term will include those terms in the search translation. If you want to prevent such mapping, put the hyphenated phrase inside double quotes: \"heart-attack\"\n\n\n\nWhen you enter search terms as a phrase, PubMed will not perform automatic term mapping that includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy. For example, \"health planning\" will include citations that are indexed to the MeSH term, Health Planning, but will not include the more specific terms, e.g., Health Care Rationing, Health Care Reform, Health Plan Implementation, that are included in the automatic MeSH mapping.\nPhrase index\nPubMed uses a phrase index to provide phrase searching. To browse the phrase index, use the Show Index feature included in the Advanced Search builder: select a search field, enter the beginning of a phrase, and then click Show Index.\nQuoted phrase not found\nPhrases may appear in a PubMed record but not be in the phrase index. To search for a phrase that is not found in the phrase index, use a proximity search with a distance of 0 (e.g., \"cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis\"[tiab:~0]); this will search for the quoted terms appearing next to each other, in any order.\nAutomated processes regularly add new phrases to the index based on standard criteria such as phrase frequency and length. If you would like to request a phrase be added to the phrase index, please write to the NLM Help Desk.\nWildcards and truncation\nTo create a wildcard search in PubMed, use an asterisk (*) to substitute for 0 or more characters in a term or phrase. For example, \"vaccin* schedul*\" will find results that include \"vaccine schedule\", \"vaccine scheduling\", \"vaccination schedules\", and more variations of this phrase.\n\nA wildcard (*) substitutes for 0 or more characters\nTerms must begin with at least 4 characters before the first wildcard: colo*\nMultiple wildcards can be used in the same term: organi*ation*\n\nTo use wildcards in a phrase search, use any of the following formats:\n\nEnclose the phrase in double quotes: \"breast feed*\"\nUse a search tag: breast feed*[tiab]\nUse a hyphen: breast-feed* \n\nPhrases can include more than one wildcard: \"colo* cancer*\"\nWildcards turn off Automatic Term Mapping (ATM) and the process that includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy. For example, \"heart attack*\" will not map to the MeSH term Myocardial Infarction or include any of the more specific terms, e.g., Myocardial Stunning; Shock, Cardiogenic.\nWildcards can be particularly useful to capture variations of a phrase, since phrase searches already turn off automatic term mapping and do not otherwise include alternate spellings or singular/plural forms. For example, searching for \"tumo*r associated macrophage*\" retrieves variations of the phrase such as: \"tumor associated macrophage\", \"tumour associated macrophage\", \"tumor associated macrophages\", and \"tumour associated macrophages\".\nCombining search terms with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\nPubMed applies an AND operator between concepts, e.g., \"vitamin c common cold\" is translated as vitamin c AND common cold. Enter Boolean operators in uppercase characters to combine or exclude search terms:\n\nAND retrieves results that include all the search terms.\nOR retrieves results that include at least one of the search terms.\nNOT excludes the retrieval of terms from your search.\n\nPubMed processes searches in a left-to-right sequence. Use parentheses to \"nest\" concepts that should be processed as a unit and then incorporated into the overall search.\n\nPubMed uses automatic term mapping to identify concepts. For example, for the search air bladder fistula, PubMed will search \"air bladder\" as a phrase. If you do not want this automatic phrase parsing, enter each term separated by the Boolean operator AND, e.g., air AND bladder AND fistula.\nSearch Details show how a search was translated.\n\nUsing search field tags\nYou can search for a term in a specific field by including a search field tag after the term; for example, UCLA[ad] will search for the term “UCLA” in the affiliation field only.\nMore information about using search field tags:\n\nThe search field tag must be enclosed in square brackets.\nCase and spacing do not matter: crabs [mh] = Crabs[mh].\nSearch field tags turn off Automatic Term Mapping (ATM), limiting your search to the specified term only.\nUsing a search field tag after multiple terms will attempt to search those terms as a phrase: kidney allograft[tiab].\nTo search multiple terms in the same field, each term must be tagged individually: covid-19[ti] vaccine[ti] children[ti].\nThe Advanced Search builder can help you search for terms in specific fields and build large, complex search strings.\n\nSearch field tags\n\nAffiliation [ad]\nAll Fields [all]\nArticle Identifier [aid]\nAuthor [au]\nAuthor Identifier [auid]\nBook [book]\nComment Correction Type\nCompletion Date [dcom]\nConflict of Interest Statement [cois]\nCorporate Author [cn]\nCreate Date [crdt]\nEC/RN Number [rn]\nEditor [ed]\nEntry Date [edat]\nFilter [filter] [sb]\nFirst Author Name [1au]\nFull Author Name [fau]\nFull Investigator Name [fir]\nGrants and Funding [gr]\nInvestigator [ir]\nISBN [isbn]\nIssue [ip]\nJournal [ta]\nLanguage [la]\nLast Author Name [lastau]\nLocation ID [lid]\nMeSH Date [mhda]\nMeSH Major Topic [majr]\nMeSH Subheadings [sh]\nMeSH Terms [mh]\nModification Date [lr]\nNLM Unique ID [jid]\nOther Term [ot]\nOwner\nPagination [pg]\nPersonal Name as Subject [ps]\nPharmacological Action [pa]\nPlace of Publication [pl]\nPMCID and MID\nPMID [pmid]\nPublication Date [dp]\nPublication Type [pt]\nPublisher [pubn]\nSecondary Source ID [si]\nSubset [sb]\nSupplementary Concept [nm]\nText Words [tw]\nTitle [ti]\nTitle/Abstract [tiab]\nTransliterated Title [tt]\nVolume [vi]\n\nProximity searching\nYou can use proximity searching to search for multiple terms appearing in any order within a specified distance of one another in the [Title], [Title/Abstract], or [Affiliation] fields.\nTo create a proximity search in PubMed, enter your terms using the following format:\n\"search terms\"[field:~N]\n\nSearch terms = Two or more words enclosed in double quotes.\nThere is no limit to the number of words you can search together in proximity; however, the more terms you enter, the more restrictive your search becomes. Using the Boolean operator AND to combine terms may be more appropriate than combining many terms into one proximity search.\n\n\nField = The search field tag for [Title], [Title/Abstract], or [Affiliation] fields.\nProximity searching is only available in the Title, Title/Abstract, and Affiliation search fields.\nYou can use the full search field tags [Title], [Title/Abstract], and [Affiliation], or the abbreviated versions [ti], [tiab], and [ad].\n\n\nN = The maximum number of words appearing between your search terms.\nWhat N value to use will depend on your search. Try changing the N value and comparing the results to find what works best for your search.\nA higher N creates a broader, more comprehensive search; this will typically retrieve more results overall, but some of these results may be less relevant. Using the Boolean operator AND to combine terms may be more appropriate than proximity searching with a large N value.\nA lower N creates a narrower, more precise search; this will typically retrieve fewer results that are highly relevant, but may exclude other relevant results.\nIf N=0, the quoted terms will appear next to each other--with no other words in between.\nFor the affiliation field only, an N value of 1,000 or less will search for the double quoted terms together within the same affiliation, rather than spread across all affiliations on the record. See Affiliation [ad] for an example proximity search in the affiliation field and more information about searching for affiliations.\n\n\n\nMore information about proximity searching:\n\nResults will include your quoted terms in any order. If you would like to search for an exact phrase with terms appearing in a specific order, use a phrase search instead.\nAutomatic Term Mapping is not applied to the quoted terms.\nProximity searching is not compatible with wildcards (*). If the double quoted terms in a proximity search include a wildcard (*), the proximity operator will be ignored.\nYou can combine proximity searches with other terms using Boolean operators; for example, \"hip pain\"[Title:~4] AND stretching\nBooleans and stopwords included in quoted terms for proximity search are searched like regular keywords.\n\nExample\nSearch PubMed for citations with the terms \"rationing\" and \"healthcare\" appearing within 2 words of each other--in any order--in the Title field:\n\"rationing healthcare\"[Title:~2]Search results may include: rationing healthcare, healthcare rationing, rationing of healthcare, rationing in healthcare, rationing universal healthcare, rationing strategies in healthcare, rationing limited healthcare… and more.\nExample\nSearch PubMed for citations with the terms \"patient,\" \"physician,\" and \"relationship\" appearing next to each other—in any order—in the Title/Abstract fields:\n\"patient physician relationship\"[Title/Abstract:~0]Since N=0, the quoted terms must appear next to each other with no other words in between them, although they can still appear in any order.\nExample\nYou can build queries that combine proximity searches with other terms using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT):\n\"accidental overdose\"[Title/Abstract:~3] AND acetaminophen \"patient physician relationship\"[tiab:~0] OR “patient doctor relationship”[tiab:~0]\nDisplay, Sort, and Navigate\n\nUnderstanding your search results\nDisplay an abstract\nChanging the display format of search results\nShowing more results\nSorting your results\nFinding the full text article\nFigures\nSimilar articles\nCited by\nReferences\nGrants and funding\nNavigating searches with more than 10,000 results\nDiscovering related data in NCBI databases\nFind related resources using LinkOut\nReporting broken or problem links\n\nUnderstanding your search results\nCitations are initially displayed 10 items per page and sorted by Best Match.\nBy default, PubMed search results are displayed in a summary format and include snippets from the citation abstract. Snippets and highlighted terms are selected based on relatedness to your query.\nTo see the abstract for an individual citation, click the title of the citation to go to its abstract page.\nJournal names are shown using the journal title abbreviation. When viewing citations in Abstract format, you can mouseover a journal’s title abbreviation to display the full journal name.\nDisplay an abstract\nClick the title of the citation to go to its abstract page, or change the search results display to Abstract format using the Display options button in the upper right corner of the search results page.\nPubMed may include non-English abstracts if supplied by the publisher. The abstract text defaults to English when a citation has an accompanying non-English abstract. Links to display the additional language(s) are available on the Abstract display. To retrieve citations with non-English abstracts, use the query hasnonenglishabstract.\nChanging the display format of search results\nResults are displayed in the summary format by default, except a single citation result will go directly to the abstract page. You can change the results format using the Display options button:\n\nClick the Display options button in the upper right corner of the search results page\nSelect the display format you would like to use\nResults will be displayed in the new format\n\nSelecting one or more items and changing the display format will display only the selected result(s) in the new format.\nBy default, the summary format includes snippets from the citation abstract.

You can use the \"Sort by\" drop-down menu at the top of the search results page to change the sort order.\nIf you change the sort order, your new selection will be active for subsequent searches until your browser cookies are cleared.\nSort orders\nYou can sort your search results by:\n\nBest Match: The Best Match sort order is based on an algorithm that analyzes each PubMed citation found with your search terms. For each search query, \"weight\" is calculated for citations depending on how many search terms are found and in which fields they are found. In addition, recently-published articles are given a somewhat higher weight for sorting. The top articles returned by the weighted term frequency algorithm above are then re-ranked for better relevance by a new machine-learning algorithm. Please see the Algorithm for finding best matching citations in PubMed for more information.\nMost Recent: Citations sorted by Most Recent are displayed in reverse date added order: last in, first out. The Most Recent date is the date a record was initially added to PubMed, not the publication date. The secondary sort is PMID.\nPublication Date: Citations sorted by Publication Date are displayed in reverse chronological order: newest to oldest. Citations with more than one publication date, such as electronic and print, are sorted by their earliest publication date. Publication dates without a month are set to January, multiple months (e.g., Oct-Dec) are set to the first month, and dates without a day are set to the first day of the month. Dates with a season are set as: winter = January, spring = April, summer = July and fall = October.\nFirst Author: Citations are sorted alphabetically by first author name. The secondary sort order within a group with the same first author is PMID.\nJournal: Citations are sorted alphabetically by journal name. The secondary sort order within a group with the same journal name is PMID.\n\nReverse sort order\n\nWhen sorting by Most Recent, Publication Date, First Author, or Journal, you can reverse the sort order by clicking the up/down arrow next to the selected sort option to toggle between ascending or descending order.\nThe reverse sort option will not display when Best Match sort order is selected.\n\nComputed author sort\nClicking an author name link on the abstract display runs a search for the author in PubMed. If an author name is computationally similar with an author name for additional PubMed citations, the results will display those citations first, in ranked order, followed by the non-similar citations. Author name disambiguation details are available in Liu W and Wilbur WJ.\nFinding the full text article\nPubMed records contain citation information (e.g., title, authors, journal, publication date) and abstracts of published articles and books. PubMed search results do not include the full text of the journal article, but the abstract view in PubMed includes links to the full text from other sources when available, such as the publisher’s website or the PubMed Central (PMC) database. The full text journal site may require a fee or subscription, however online journals sometimes provide free access. Access may also be available through your organization, or local medical library.\nYou may be able to obtain free copies of full text articles in these ways:\nFree full text filter\nOn the filter sidebar, click \"Free full text\" to narrow results to resources that are available for free on the web, including PubMed Central, Bookshelf, and publishers' websites. Alternately, include free full text[Filter] in your query.\nPubMed Central\nWhen full text is available in PubMed Central (PMC), the \"Free in PMC\" icon will appear on the citation's abstract display under Full Text Links. Click the icon to view the article in PMC.\nPubMed Central (PMC) is the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature.\nFrom the publisher\nJournal publishers or related organizations may provide access to articles for free, for free after registering as an individual or guest, or for a fee. When provided by the publisher or other organization, icons linking to these sources can be found on the citation's abstract display under the \"Full Text Links\" and/or \"LinkOut\" sections. Icons will often indicate free full text when the article is available for free.\nNote: When you click a full text icon or link in PubMed, you leave PubMed and are directed to the full text at an external provider's site. NCBI does not hold the copyright to this material, and cannot give permission for its use. Users should review all copyright restrictions set forth by the full text provider before reproducing, redistributing, or making commercial use of material accessed through LinkOut.\nPlease see the Copyright and Disclaimers page for additional information.\nIf you are affiliated with a hospital, university, or other institution\nYour local medical library is your best option. If you see icons for your library on the abstract view this indicates that your library provides a link to the article, has the journal in its collection, or may otherwise obtain the article for you through interlibrary loan. If your library does not have access to the article you need, ask a librarian about ordering the article from another institution.\nLocal library\nSome local libraries have copies of medical journals or can get a copy of an article for you. Ask your local librarian about inter-library loan options and fees.\nFigures\nPubMed abstracts include figures when the full text article is available in PubMed Central (PMC). Click the thumbnail to view a larger version of the image, caption, and link to the figure and copyright information in PMC. Figures correspond to the article version archived in PMC, which in some cases may be the Author Manuscript version.\nSimilar articles\nThe abstract page for a citation includes links to PubMed citations for similar articles. The \"See all similar articles\" link will retrieve a pre-calculated set of PubMed citations that are closely related to the selected article:\n\nSimilar articles are displayed in ranked order from most to least relevant, with the \"linked from\" citation displayed first.\nSimilar articles are generated by comparing words from the title, abstract, and MeSH terms using a word-weighted algorithm.\nFilters are not activated for similar articles.\nYou can refine the list of similar articles using your search History, where the similar articles retrieval is represented as a list of PMIDs. Use this search number in a search. Refining the list removes the ranked order and may remove citations that are most relevant.\n\nSee Computation of similar articles for more information.\nCited by\nPubMed abstracts include links to other resources citing the current item. \"Cited by\" is generated using data submitted by publishers and from NCBI resources, when available. \"Cited by\" may not be a complete list of works citing a particular item.\nReferences\nPubMed abstracts include references when available. Reference lists are available for citations to full text articles included in the open access subset of PMC and for citations where the publisher supplied references in the citation data sent to PubMed.\nGrants and funding\nPubMed displays grant numbers, contract numbers, and intramural research identifiers that have been associated with a publication by:\n\nPublishers when depositing data in PubMed and PubMed Central;\nAn author, principal investigator, or project director when:\ndepositing a manuscript through the NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) or Europe PMC Plus system; or\nwhen adding a publication to My Bibliography; and/or\n\n\nNLM text mining and indexing processes.\n\nA grant award or contract may be acknowledged in an article and, therefore, displayed in PubMed, for various reasons, including support for activities that contributed directly to the publication as well as support for the generation of an underlying dataset or another shared resource. Additionally, some articles may not explicitly acknowledge intramural research support, yet the authors may be affiliated with a funding agency and may have associated their intramural support with a PubMed record at the time of manuscript deposit to PMC.\nFunding information in PubMed is collected in or converted to a standardized format when possible to enable broad discovery and impact monitoring. For example, if a publication acknowledges support from NIH grant number 1R01 GM987654-01-A1 or GM987654 or ROI GM987654 in a publication, in PubMed the funding information would be normalized to R01 GM987654, consistent with NIH requirements for proper grant number format. Funding associations made in a manuscript submission, grant reporting, or indexing system use standardized project identifiers provided to NLM by the organization administering the funding. To learn about searching funding information, see the search field section on Grants and funding [gr].\nThe scope of funding information included in PubMed has expanded over time to support the public access policies of NIH and other funding organizations. Since 1981, NLM has included grant or contract numbers or both that designate financial support by any agency of the United States Public Health Service (PHS), including NIH. Until 2000, only up to three grant numbers were included. Beginning in March 2006, funding information was expanded in PubMed to include grant, contract, and intramural funding assertions made in NIHMS and My Bibliography to support the NIH Public Access Policy. Publishers have been able to supply funding information directly to PubMed since January 2017.\nReporting funding information errors\nSome publications may be inadvertently linked to the wrong funding information. For example, the association of a publication to NIH-funded extramural research requires that the author(s) acknowledge NIH support in the article and that the acknowledgement be in a form that can be readily associated with a specific grant or contract. Variations in the format used to cite NIH funding may lead to either an inability to make an association or erroneous matches of publications to grants and contracts.\nIf you identify an error in funding information associated with a PubMed record, please contact the NLM help desk. NLM will not remove funding associations that reflect the acknowledged funding in the article without a published correction to ensure alignment with the scientific record. If an award association was provided by the author, principal investigator, or project director in My Bibliography or the NIHMS for formal NIH progress and public access compliance reporting, removing the association requires the principal investigator be notified and confirm the lack of direct support.\nNavigating searches with more than 10,000 results\nPubMed can display up to 10,000 results. The following options can help you navigate searches with more than 10,000 results:\n\nReverse the sort order to see the last results first.\nDivide the result set into smaller chunks using the results timeline or custom date range filter.\nAdjust your search to retrieve fewer results.\nFor programmatic use and bulk downloads, PubMed data is available via FTP.\n\nDiscovering related data in NCBI databases\nWhen available, links to other related NCBI databases are included on a citation's Abstract page under the Related information section. The complete list of database options is provided in Entrez Link Descriptions.\nMEDLINE indexed citations include additional supplemental information on the Abstract page such as MeSH terms, publication types, and substances with links to search for these data in PubMed and the MeSH Database.\nTo simultaneously search all NCBI databases, use the NCBI Search page.\nFind related resources using LinkOut\nMost PubMed records include LinkOut resources to a variety of websites including publishers, aggregators, libraries, biological databases, and sequence centers. LinkOut resources link to providers’ sites to obtain the full text of articles or related information, e.g., consumer health. There may be a charge to access the text or information from a provider's site.\nTo view LinkOut resources, navigate to the LinkOut section at the end of an individual citation's abstract page.\nTo find citations with links to free full text articles, apply the \"Free full text\" filter to your search results.\nTo find citations with links to full text articles, enter search terms followed by AND full text[sb].\nMore information about Links:\n\nLinkOut resource categories such as \"free full text\" have been selected by the LinkOut provider.\nThe current list of LinkOut providers is available.\nA publisher's icon link may display on the abstract format if they have electronically provided their citation data to NCBI. Links are only available for publishers that are participating in LinkOut; publishers are responsible for providing working links.\n\nReporting broken or problem links\nLinkOut links are supplied by the LinkOut providers. Publishers who electronically supply their data to PubMed may include an icon that links to a site providing the full text. Corrections and changes to links are made by the providers and are their responsibility.\nTo report problem links or inquire about online journal subscriptions, contact the provider directly. Contact information is typically available at a provider's web site.\nCite, Save, and Share\n\nSave citations temporarily using the Clipboard\nSave citations indefinitely using My NCBI Collections\nSave citations as a text file\nCite an article\nExport citations into citation management software\nEmail citations\nCreate an email alert for a search\nCreate an RSS feed for a search\nPrint your search results\nGet a permalink to bookmark or share your search\nDownload PubMed data\n\nSave citations temporarily using the Clipboard\nThe Clipboard provides a place to collect up to 500 items from one or more searches.

For some fields, an autocomplete feature will provide suggestions as you type.\n\nFrom the \"All Fields\" drop-down menu, select the field you would like to search.\nAdd terms from the builder to the query box to construct your search. The default Boolean operator is AND; if desired, choose OR or NOT from the pull-down menu.\nOnce you have finished adding terms to the query box, click Search (or Add to History) to run the search.\n\nYou may also search a specific field -- and bypass Automatic Term Mapping -- by adding a search field tag to a term.\nBrowsing the index of terms\nThe Advanced Search Builder includes the Show Index feature, which provides an alphabetical display of terms appearing in selected PubMed search fields. You can browse by all fields or within specific fields such as MeSH Terms.\n\nClick Advanced to navigate to the Advanced Search page, and use the Builder to select a search field from the All Fields menu. Note: Show Index is not available for every search field. The Show Index link will only display for fields that are compatible with this feature.\nEnter a term in the search box, then click Show Index.\nThe index displays an alphabetic list of search terms and the approximate number of citations for each term (the actual citation count is returned when the search is executed).\nScroll until you find a term you want to include in your search, and then highlight it to add it to the search box.\nMultiple terms may be selected from the list and added to the search box.\nAdd terms from the builder to the query box to construct your search.\nOnce you have finished adding terms to the query box, click Search (or Add to History) to run the search.\n\nMore information about using the index:\n\nPubMed processes all Boolean operators left to right.\nThe builder will automatically OR (and add parentheses) for multiple terms selected from the index.\nA slash will display after a space. For example, the MeSH Term and Subheading \"zika virus/analysis\" will display after \"zika virus infection/virology.\" Enter MeSH terms followed by a slash to go directly to the display for the MeSH/Subheading combination counts in the index.\nShow Index is not available for date fields.\n\nHistory\nYour PubMed search history appears on the Advanced Search page under History. This feature requires your web browser to accept cookies.\nDescriptions of each column in the History table appear below:\n\nSearch: Searches are numbered in chronological order.\nSearch numbers may be used in place of the search string itself when combining queries (e.g., #1 OR #2).\nA repeated query will move to the top of History but will retain its original numbering.\nHistory is limited to the last 100 searches. Once the maximum number is reached, PubMed will remove the oldest search from history and add the most current search.\n\n\nActions: Add, delete, or save a query. Adding queries from History places the search string into the Query box to be used in the next search. Deleting a query removes it from History.\nQuery: This column shows previous search strings as entered by the user.\nDetails: PubMed may modify or add search terms to a search to optimize retrieval, e.g., using automatic term mapping.

Please see the terms and conditions for data users.\nCitation Matcher API\n\nAPI root\nFielded search\nHeuristic search\nAuto search\nRate control\n\nThe PubMed Citation Matcher API finds PubMed identifiers (PMIDs) for citation data in structured or raw form. The interface supports three retrieval methods:\n\nfield - runs a fielded search using core bibliographic information, such as journal, date, or volume.\nheuristic - collects all input elements into a single string and returns the closest matching documents.\nauto - combines the two above methods and switches to heuristic mode if the fielded search has not yielded a result. This is the default method.\n\nMore information about the Citation Matcher API:\n\nThe API supports both GET and POST requests.\nData is exchanged in JSON.\nInput data should be UTF-8 encoded.\nThe API returns a maximum of 20 PMIDs; queries returning more than 20 PMIDs are treated as bad requests.\n\nAPI root\nThe API root is:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/\nFielded search\nmethod=field runs a fielded search using core bibliographic information, such as journal, date, or volume. This functionality is similar to E-utilities ESearch; users should select the API that best suits their needs.\nFor a structured search, the following fields can be used:\n\njournal - the name of the journal\npdat - the publication date, in the format YYYY/MM/DD\nvolume - the volume of the publication\nissue - the volume of the publication\nauthors - one or more author names, in the format \"Surname Initial\" (Doe J). Optionally, the position may be specified as first, last, or auto.\n\nExample\nExample fielded search:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=field&journal=Front%20Immunol&volume=13&page=826091\nExample\nGET request URL:\n/citmatch/?method=field&journal=Front+Immunol&volume=13&page=826091&authors=Ihunwo+A\nPOST request data:\n{\n    \"citmatch\": {\n        \"method\": \"field\",\n        \"journal\": \"Front Immunol\",\n        \"volume\": \"13\",\n        \"page\": \"826091\",\n        \"authors\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Ihunwo AO\",\n                \"position\": \"first\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\nResponse:\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"operation\": \"citmatch\",\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"type\": \"uids\",\n        \"uids\": [\n            {\"pubmed\": \"35251006\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}                \nHeuristic search\nmethod=heuristic collects all input elements into a single string and returns the closest matching documents. It is sufficient to supply a raw citation string, such as: \"The role of drag in insect hovering. J. Exp. Biol. 2004;207:4147–4155.\"\nExample\nExample heuristic search:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=heuristic&raw-text=Neurogenesis%20and%20Viral%20Infection.%20Front%20Immunol.%202022%20Feb%2017;13:82609\nExample\nGET request URL:\n/citmatch/?method=heuristic&raw-text=Neurogenesis+and+Viral+Infection.+Front+Immunol.+2022+Feb+17;13:82609.\nPOST request data:\n{\n    \"citmatch\": {\n        \"method\": \"heuristic\",\n        \"raw-text\": {\"text\": \"Neurogenesis+and+Viral+Infection.+Front+Immunol.+2022+Feb+17;13:82609.\"}\n    }\n}\nResponse:\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"operation\": \"citmatch\",\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"type\": \"uids\",\n        \"uids\": [\n            {\"pubmed\": \"35251006\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}              \nAuto search\nmethod=auto first runs a fielded search, and if no results are found, it combines the fields and runs a heuristic search. This is the default method.\nFor a structured search, the following fields can be used:\n\njournal - the name of the journal\npdat - the publication date, in the format YYYY/MM/DD\nvolume - the volume of the publication\nissue - the volume of the publication\nauthors - one or more author names, in the format \"Surname Initial\" (Doe J). Optionally, the position may be specified as first, last, or auto.\n\nExample\nExample auto search:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=auto&journal=Front+Immunol&volume=13&page=826091&authors=Ranganathan+SFirst, a fielded search is run but no results are found due to the specified author not appearing on the citation:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=field&journal=Front+Immunol&volume=13&page=826091&authors=Ranganathan+SThen it concatenates the fields and runs a heuristic search, which returns the closest matching document(s):\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=heuristic&raw-text=Front+Immunol+13+826091+Ranganathan+S\nRate control\nWhen using the PubMed Citation Matcher API programmatically, we request that you limit your application's rate to 3 requests / sec and do not make concurrent requests to this service, even at off-peak times. Additionally, requests must contain the name of the calling project in the User-Agent HTTP header value; e.g. Hydra/1.3.15.\nBatch Citation Matcher\nUse the Batch Citation Matcher to retrieve PMIDs for multiple citations. The Batch Citation Matcher requires that you enter the bibliographic information (journal, volume, page, etc.) in a specific format.\nTo retrieve PubMed PMIDs:\n\nCreate citation strings for the items you would like to retrieve using the following format:\n    journal_title|year|volume|first_page|author_name|your_key|\n    Fields must be separated by a vertical bar with a final bar at the end of the string.\nEnter your email address. Email messages may take several minutes to process and be sent to your email address.\nUpload your citation strings as a text file (.txt) or enter each citation string on a separate line in the text box. If citation strings are entered in the text box and a file is uploaded, the results will be an aggregate of both.\nClick search.\n\nIf a match is not found the citation string will display one of the following:\n\nyour_key|NOT_FOUND;INVALID_JOURNAL - The journal name is not valid. See the journal lists or the NLM Catalog to find the correct journal abbreviation.\nNOT_FOUND - The journal name is valid, but the citation string did not find a match.\nAMBIGUOUS - The information provided matches more than one citation. Citation information with 3 or fewer matches include the PMIDs, and more than 3 matches include the total PMID match count. Use the Single Citation Matcher or ESearch to retrieve all citations for searched fields.\n\nNotes:\n\nText (.txt) format must be used when uploading a file.\nYou may receive multiple emails for searches containing more than 2,000 citation strings.\nEnter author names without punctuation as smith jc. Initials are optional.\nYour key is any string you choose to tag the citation, it is returned unaltered.\nThe journal title field may include the full journal title or the NLM title abbreviation.\nEach citation field is searched starting with the journal title until a unique match is found.\nThe journal title is a required field however you may omit other fields. If you omit fields you must retain the vertical bars in the citation string. For example, if you omit the volume number 88 from the first example below it should be entered as:\n    proc natl acad sci u s a|1991||3248|mann bj|P32022-1|\n\nExample input:\n\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1991|88|3248|mann bj|P32022-1|\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1992|89|3271|gould se|P26261-1|\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1970|89|3271|smith|P26261-1|\nres microbiol|1992|143|467|ivey dm|P25966-1|\nscience|1987|235|182|palmenberg ac|P12296-2|\neschatology|1993|12|22|public jq|C12233-2|\nvirology|1993|193|492|hardy me|Q02945-1|\nvirus genes|1992|6|393||P27423-1|\nyeast|1992|8|253|sasnauskas k|P24813-1|\n\nExample output:\n\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1991|88|3248|mann bj|P32022-1|2014248\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1992|89|3271|gould se|P26261-1|1565618\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1970|89|3271|smith|P26261-1|NOT_FOUND\nres microbiol|1992|143|467|ivey dm|P25966-1|1448623\nscience|1987|235|182|palmenberg ac|P12296-2|3026048\nC12233-2|NOT_FOUND;INVALID_JOURNAL\nvirology|1993|193|492|hardy me|Q02945-1|8382410\nvirus genes|1992|6|393||P27423-1|1335631\nyeast|1992|8|253|sasnauskas k|P24813-1|1514324\n\nConsumer health\nThe National Library of Medicine cannot provide specific medical advice.

If you want to report a translation that does not seem accurate for your search topic, please e-mail the information to the NLM Help Desk.\n1. Subject translation table\nThe Subject Translation Table contains:\n\nBritish and American spellings\nPairs: singular and plural word forms, synonyms, and other closely related terms\nDrug brand name to generic name translations\nMeSH terms\nThe See-Reference mappings (also known as entry terms) for MeSH terms\nMeSH Subheadings\nPublication Types\nPharmacologic action terms\nTerms derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) that have equivalent synonyms or lexical variants in English\nSupplementary concept (substance) names and their synonyms.\n\nIf a match is found in this translation table, the term will be searched as MeSH (that includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy), and in all fields.\nFor example, if you enter child rearing in the search box, PubMed will translate this search to: \"child rearing\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"child\"[All Fields] AND \"rearing\"[All Fields]) OR \"child rearing\"[All Fields]\nIf you enter a MeSH Term that is also a Pharmacologic Action PubMed will search the term as [MeSH Terms], [Pharmacologic Action], and [All Fields].\nIf you enter an entry term for a MeSH term the translation will also include an all fields search for the MeSH term associated with the entry term. For example, a search for odontalgia will translate to: \"toothache\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"toothache\"[All Fields] OR \"odontalgia\"[All Fields] OR \"odontalgias\"[All Fields] because Odontalgia is an entry term for the MeSH term toothache.\nSubstance name mappings do not include a mapping for individual terms in a phrase, e.g., IL-22 will not include IL[All Fields] AND 22[All Fields].\nMeSH term mappings that include a standalone number or single character do not include a mapping for individual terms in a phrase, e.g., Protein C will not include Protein[All Fields] or C[All Fields].\n2. Journals translation table\nThe Journals translation table contains the:\n\nfull journal title\ntitle abbreviation\nISSN and eISSN number.\n\nThese will automatically map to the journal abbreviation that is used to search journals in PubMed and in all fields. For example, a search for endocrine pathology will translate to: \"Endocr Pathol\"[Journal] OR (\"endocrine\"[All Fields] AND \"pathology\"[All Fields]) OR \"endocrine pathology\"[All Fields]\n3. Author index\nIf the term is not found in the above tables, and is not a single term, PubMed checks the author index for a match. The author index includes author names and initials, as well as full author names for articles published from 2002 forward, if available.\nMore information about author searching:\n\nPubMed automatically truncates a search for an author's name to account for varying initials, e.g., o'brien j retrieves o'brien ja, o'brien jb, o'brien jc jr, as well as o'brien j.\nWhen combining multiple authors, to avoid a match with full author names, include initials or use the [au] search tag, e.g., ryan[au] james[au]. Author names comprised of only stopwords, e.g., as a, are not searched as authors if they are part of phrase, chemical burn as a danger, unless the search only includes the author name, e.g., as a.\nEnter a full author name in natural or inverted order, e.g., julia s wong or wong julia s.\nA comma following the last name for searching is optional. For some names, however, it is necessary to distinguish which name is the last name by using the comma following the last name, e.g., james, ryan.\nOmit periods after initials and put all suffixes at the end, e.g., vollmer charles jr\nInitials and suffixes are not required, if you include a middle initial or suffix, you will only retrieve citations for articles that were published using the middle initial or suffix.\nTo distinguish author initials that may match a full author name use the [fau] search tag, e.g., peterson do[fau].\n\n4. Investigator (Collaborator) index\nIf the term is not found in the above tables, except for Author, and is not a single term, the investigator index is consulted for a match. The investigator (collaborator) index includes full names, if available. Enter a full investigator name in natural or inverted order, e.g., harry janes or janes harry.\n5. If no match is found?\nPubMed breaks apart the phrase and repeats the above automatic term mapping process until a match is found. PubMed ignores stopwords in searches.\nIf there is no match, the individual terms will be combined (ANDed) together and searched in all fields.\nWhen a search includes terms that were tagged with a search field during the automatic term mapping process and retrieves zero results, the system triggers a subsequent search using \"Schema: all .\" \"Schema: all\" modifies the search by removing the automatically added search field tags, and then searches each term in all fields.\nAlgorithm for finding best matching citations in PubMed\nThe learned ranking algorithm combines over 150 signals that are helpful for finding best matching results. Most of these signals are computed from the query-document term pairs (e.g., number of term matches between the query and the document) while others are either specific to a document (e.g., publication type; publication year) or query (e.g., query length). The new ranking model was built on relevance data extracted from the anonymous and aggregated PubMed search logs over an extended period of time.\nFor more information about the Best Match algorithm, please see:\n\nTechnical details in the paper Best Match: New relevance search for PubMed by Fiorini N, Canese K, Starchenko G, et al. in PLoS Biol (2018).\nNLM Technical Bulletin article: Updated Algorithm for the PubMed Best Match Sort Order\n\nPubMed coverage\nThe PubMed database contains citations and abstracts to biomedical literature, facilitating searching across several NLM literature resources:\n\nMEDLINE\nPubMed Central (PMC)\nNCBI Bookshelf\n\nFor additional information, please see the NLM Fact Sheet: Medline, PubMed, and PMC (PubMed Central): How are they different?\nPubMed includes citations to original research articles, literature reviews, case reports, letters, editorials, commentaries, and other selected publications on scientific and medical topics (see: publication types found in PubMed). Some categories of content are out of scope for PubMed, such as: book reviews, individual conference abstracts, obituaries and in memoriam articles, news and announcements, and brief summaries of research articles. More examples are included in XML Help for PubMed Data Providers: What types of articles are accepted?.\nMEDLINE\nMEDLINE contains citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine. The MEDLINE database contains citations from the late 1940s to the present, with some older material.\nNew citations from MEDLINE journals are received electronically from publishers and appear in PubMed daily. Most citations progress to in-process, and then to indexed for MEDLINE; however, not all citations will be indexed for MEDLINE. PubMed includes some citations from MEDLINE journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as:\n\nCitations preceding the date that a journal was selected for MEDLINE indexing.\nOut-of-scope citations (e.g., articles on plate tectonics or astrophysics) from certain MEDLINE journals, primarily general science and chemistry journals, for which the life sciences articles are indexed for MEDLINE.\n\nCitations that have been indexed for MEDLINE and updated with NLM Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), publication types, GenBank accession numbers, and other indexing data are available daily. To limit your search to MEDLINE citations, add medline[sb] to your search.\nIndexing method\nThe method used to assign Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) has changed over time. For more information, please see Incorporating Values for Indexing Method in MEDLINE/PubMed XML. Use the following searches to find citations indexed with each method:\n\nAutomated - MeSH indexing is provided algorithmically. Search: indexingmethod_automated\nCurated - MeSH indexing is provided algorithmically and a human reviewed (and possibly modified) the algorithm results. Search: indexingmethod_curated\nManual – MeSH indexing is provided by humans with no algorithmic suggestions. Search: indexingmethod_manual\n\nPubMed Central (PMC)\nPubMed Central (PMC) is a full text archive that includes articles from journals reviewed and selected by NLM for archiving (current and historical), as well as individual articles and preprints collected for archiving in compliance with funder policies. Some PMC content is not cited in PubMed, such as book reviews and conference abstracts (see: PubMed coverage).\nPreprints\nAs of June 2020, PubMed Central (PMC) includes preprints that report NIH-funded research results. Citations to these preprints are deposited in PubMed. To learn more, see: NIH Preprint Pilot.\nExample\nTo search for preprints in PubMed, include preprint[filter] in your query.\ncovid-19 AND preprint[pt]\nExample\nTo exclude preprints from your search results in PubMed, use the Boolean operator NOT.\ncovid-19 NOT preprint[pt]\nNCBI Bookshelf\nBookshelf is a full text archive of books, reports, databases, and other documents related to biomedical, health, and life sciences. PubMed includes citations for books and some individual chapters available on Bookshelf.\nPubMed format\nThe PubMed Format tags table defines the data tags that compose the PubMed format. The tags are presented in alphabetical order. Some of the tags (e.g., CIN) are not mandatory and therefore will not be found in every record. Other tags (e.g., AU, MH, and RN) may occur multiple times in one record. You can download records in PubMed format as a text file (.txt) or as an .nbib file for exporting into citation management software programs.\nNot all fields are searchable in PubMed.

If a field is searchable, the search tag appears after the field name in square brackets: Affiliation [ad]. A small number of searchable fields do not correspond to a specific field in the PubMed format.\n\nSee Search field tags for a list of searchable fields.\nSee PubMed format for a quick table view of the fields found in PubMed records.\n\nAffiliation [ad]\nAffiliation may be included for authors, corporate authors and investigators, e.g., cleveland [ad] AND clinic [ad], if submitted by the publisher.\nMultiple affiliations were added to citations starting from 2014, previously only the first author’s affiliation was included. PubMed includes the note \"Contributed equally\" in the affiliation field when this information is supplied by publishers.\nSearching for terms in the affiliation field searches in all author affiliations on a citation. For example, a search for Hopkins[ad] AND Bloomberg[ad] can find these terms spread across multiple authors’ affiliations on the same citation.\nTo search for multiple terms appearing within the same affiliation, use a proximity search. You can also search affiliations using a phrase search; however, we suggest using a proximity search for more comprehensive results because affiliation data may be provided in a variety of ways for the same institution.\nExample\nUse proximity searching to find citations with authors from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:\n\"Hopkins Bloomberg Public\"[ad:~45]This search will find any citation where the words \"Hopkins,\" \"Bloomberg,\" and \"Public\" appear in the same affiliation, with no more than forty-five words between each term. Search results may include:\n\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nJohns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health\nBloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University\nBloomberg Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health\n...and more!\n\nAll Fields [all]\nUntagged terms and terms tagged with [all] are processed using Automatic Term Mapping (ATM). Terms that do not map are searched in all search fields except for Place of Publication, Create Date, Completion Date, Entry Date, MeSH Date, and Modification Date. Terms enclosed in double quotes or including wildcards (*) will be searched in all fields and not processed using automatic term mapping. PubMed ignores stopwords.\nArticle Identifier [aid]\nIncludes article identifiers submitted by journal publishers such as DOI (digital object identifier).\nAuthor [au]\nThe format to search for this field is: last name followed by a space and up to the first two initials followed by a space and a suffix abbreviation, if applicable, all without periods or a comma after the last name (e.g., fauci as or o'brien jc jr). Initials and suffixes may be omitted when searching.\nPubMed automatically truncates a search for an author's name to account for varying initials, e.g., o'brien j [au] will retrieve o'brien ja, o'brien jb, o'brien jc jr, as well as o'brien j. To turn off automatic truncation, enclose the author's name in double quotes and tag with [au] in brackets, e.g., \"o'brien j\" [au] to retrieve just o'brien j.\nSearching by full author name for articles published from 2002 forward is also possible, if available. See NLM policy on author names.\nAuthor Identifier [auid]\nThe author identifier includes a unique identifier associated with an author, corporate or investigator name, if supplied by a publisher. The field includes the organization authority that established the unique identifier, such as, ORCID, ISNI, VIAF, e.g., orcid 0000-0001-5027-4446 [auid].\nBook [book]\nThe book search field includes book citations, e.g., genereviews [book].\nUse the following untagged searches to retrieve all book or book chapters, e.g., ataxia AND pmcbookchapter\n\nbooks and chapters: pmcbook\nbooks: pmcbooktitle\nbook chapters: pmcbookchapter\n\nThe above searches capture book records provided by the NCBI Bookshelf database; they exclude a small number of documents from other providers that appear in both PubMed and Bookshelf. For the most comprehensive search of records appearing in both PubMed and Bookshelf, search \"pubmed books\"[sb].\nComment Correction Type\nThe data in these fields are citations to other associated journal publications, e.g., comments or errata. Often these link to the respective citation. Comments/Corrections data can be retrieved by the search term that follows each type:\n\nComment in: hascommentin\nComment on: hascommenton\nCorrected and republished in: hascorrectedrepublishedin\nCorrected and republished from: hascorrectedrepublishedfrom\nDataset use reported in: hasassociatedpublication\nDataset described in: hasassociateddataset\nErratum in: haserratumin\nErratum for: haserratumfor\nExpression of concern in: hasexpressionofconcernin\nExpression of concern for: hasexpressionofconcernfor\nOriginal Report in: hasoriginalreportin\nRepublished in: hasrepublishedin\nRepublished from: hasrepublishedfrom\nRetracted and republished in: hasretractedandrepublishedin\nRetracted and republished from: hasretractedandrepublishedfrom\nRetraction in: hasretractionin\nRetraction of: hasretractionof\nSummary for patients in: hassummaryforpatientsin\nUpdate in: hasupdatein\nUpdate of: hasupdateof\n\nCompletion Date [dcom]\nUsed by NLM for internal processing. Completon Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [dcom] search tag is required.\nConflict of Interest Statement [cois]\nThe conflict of interest statement from the published article. Conflict of interest statements are available when supplied by the publisher in the citation data sent to PubMed, or when included in full text articles in PubMed Central (PMC).\nTo retrieve all citations that contain conflict of interest statements, use the query hascois.\nCorporate Author [cn]\nCorporate author identifies the corporate or collective authorship of an article. Corporate names display exactly as they appear in the journal.\nNote: Citations indexed pre-2000 and some citations indexed in 2000-2001 retain corporate authors at the end of the title field. For comprehensive searches, consider including terms and/or words searched in the title field [ti].\nCreate Date [crdt]\nThe date the citation record was first created in PubMed. Create Date can be helpful when checking PubMed for citations added since the last time a query was run. Create Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [crdt] search tag is required.\nEC/RN Number [rn]\nEC/RN numbers are assigned by:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Substance Registration System for Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNIIs), e.g., Y92OUS2H9B\nThe Enzyme Commission (EC) to designate a particular enzyme, e.g., EC 1.1.1.57\nThe Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for Registry Numbers, e.g., 2751-14-6\n\nThe EC/RN number search field includes both the Registry Number and the Related Registry Number (available in the NLM MeSH Browser).\nEditor [ed]\nThe editor search field includes the editors for book or chapter citations.\nEntry Date [edat]\nEntry date (EDAT) is used for PubMed processing, such as “Most Recent” sort order (i.e., last in, first out).\nEDAT is typically set within 24 hours of the citation’s availability in PubMed. Exceptions: As of December 15, 2008, citations added to PubMed more than twelve months after the date of publication have the EDAT set to the date of publication, except for book citations. Prior to this, the Entry Date was set to the Publication Date on citations published before September 1997. Entry Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [edat] search tag is required.\nNote: Entry Date was called Entrez Date in the legacy PubMed system (retired in 2020).\nFilter [filter] [sb]\nTechnical tags used by LinkOut, filters include:\n\nloall[sb] - citations with LinkOut links in PubMed\nfree full text[sb] - citations that include a link to a free full text article\nfull text[sb] - citations that include a link to a full text article\n\nFirst Author Name [1au]\nThe first personal author name in a citation.\nFull Author Name [fau]\nThe full author name for articles published from 2002 forward, if available. Full author searches can be entered in natural or inverted order, e.g., julia s wong or wong julia s.\nFull Investigator Name [fir]\nThe index for the article's full investigator or collaborator name, if available. Full investigator searches can be entered in natural or inverted order, e.g., harry janes or janes harry.\nGrants and Funding [gr]\nThe Grants and funding [gr] search field (previously Grant Number) includes grant numbers, contract numbers, or other intramural research identifiers associated with a publication.\nThe most common type of funding information associated with a publication in PubMed are grant numbers. Data in the Grants and funding search field can consist of up to four parts:\n\nNumber contains the grant, contract, intramural project number (or both) that designates financial support by any agency of the United States Public Health Service (US PHS), any institute of the National Institutes of Health, or other organization.\nFunder code contains the 2-letter grant code or funding organization acronym, for example: CA for National Cancer Institute or DDCF for Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. See Grant Number Information Found in the GR Field in MEDLINE/PubMed (Archived) for the 2-character abbreviations, PHS agency acronyms, and other US and non-US funding organizations.\nAgency includes the acronym or mnemonic in the case of US PHS agencies, or full organization name. As of 2009 this includes the agency's hierarchical structure from lower to higher entity, when known. For example, NCI NIH HHS for National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nCountry contains the home country of the funding agency, for example: United States.\n\nEach individual part can be searched using [gr], for example: CA101211[gr], CA[gr], NCI[gr], NIH[gr], or United States[gr].\nThis field can also be searched to find articles with intramural support; e.g., \"intramural nih\"[gr] finds all journal citations authored by intramural NIH staff.\nCompleteness of funding information in PubMed will vary by source.\nSee Grants and funding for more information about data in this field.\nInvestigator [ir]\nNames of principal investigator(s) or collaborators who contributed to the research. Search names following the author field format, for example: soller b[ir].\nISBN [isbn]\nThe ISBN for book or book chapters.\nIssue [ip]\nThe number of the journal issue in which the article was published.\nJournal [ta]\nThe journal search field includes the journal title abbreviation, full journal title, or ISSN/eISSN number (e.g., J Biol Chem, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 0021-9258). If a journal title contains special characters, e.g., parentheses, brackets, enter the name without these characters, e.g., enter J Hand Surg [Am] as J Hand Surg Am.\nLanguage [la]\nThe language search field includes the language in which the article was published. Note that many non-English articles have English language abstracts. You may search using either the language or the first three characters of most languages, e.g., chi [la] retrieves the same results as chinese [la]. The most notable exception is jpn [la] for Japanese.\nLast Author Name [lastau]\nThe last personal author name in a citation.\nLocation ID [lid]\nLocation ID includes the DOI or publisher ID that serves the role of pagination to locate an online article.\nMeSH Date [mhda]\nThe date the citation was indexed with MeSH Terms and elevated to MEDLINE for citations with an Entry Date after March 4, 2000. The MeSH Date is initially set to the Entry Date when the citation is added to PubMed. MeSH Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [mhda] search tag is required.\nDates must be entered using the format YYYY/MM/DD [mhda], e.g., 2000/03/15 [mhda]. The month and day are optional (e.g., 2000 [mhda] or 2000/03 [mhda]).\nTo enter a date range, insert a colon (:) between each date, e.g., 1999:2000 [mhda] or 2000/03:2000/04 [mhda].\nMeSH Major Topic [majr]\nA MeSH term that is one of the main topics discussed in the article denoted by an asterisk on the MeSH term or MeSH/Subheading combination, e.g., Cytokines/physiology* See MeSH Terms [mh] below.\nMeSH Subheadings [sh]\nMeSH Subheadings are used with MeSH terms to help describe more completely a particular aspect of a subject. For example, the drug therapy of asthma is displayed as asthma/drug therapy; see MeSH/Subheading Combinations in MeSH Terms [mh] below.\nThe MeSH Subheading field allows users to \"free float\" Subheadings, e.g., hypertension [mh] AND toxicity [sh].\nMeSH Subheadings automatically include the more specific Subheading terms under the term in a search. To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [sh:noexp], e.g., therapy [sh:noexp].\nIn addition, you can enter the two-letter MeSH Subheading abbreviations rather than spelling out the Subheading, e.g., dh [sh] = diet therapy [sh].\nMeSH Terms [mh]\nThe NLM Medical Subject Headings controlled vocabulary of biomedical terms that is used to describe the subject of each journal article in MEDLINE. MeSH is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. MeSH terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. PubMed allows you to view this hierarchy and select terms for searching in the MeSH Database.\nMEDLINE articles are automatically indexed with MeSH terms using a well-refined algorithm. Applying the MeSH vocabulary ensures that articles are uniformly indexed by subject, whatever the author's words. For more information, see Frequently Asked Questions about Indexing for MEDLINE.\nMore information about MeSH Terms and Major MeSH Topic search fields:\n\nTo search the term only as a MeSH term, it must be tagged using the search field, e.g., [mh] for MeSH Terms or [majr] for MeSH Major Topic. A tagged term is checked against the subject translation table, and then mapped to the appropriate MeSH term(s). To turn off mapping to multiple MeSH terms, enter the tagged MeSH term in double quotes.\nMeSH terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. MeSH terms in PubMed automatically include the more specific MeSH terms in a search. To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [mh:noexp], e.g., neoplasms [mh:noexp].For more detailed information about MeSH vocabulary including the hierarchical structure, please see the MeSH homepage.\nMeSH/Subheading Combinations: To directly attach MeSH Subheadings, use the format MeSH Term/Subheading, e.g., neoplasms/diet therapy. You may also use the two-letter MeSH Subheading abbreviations, e.g., neoplasms/dh. The [mh] tag is not required, however [majr] may be used, e.g., plants/genetics[majr]. Only one Subheading may be directly attached to a MeSH term. For a MeSH/Subheading combination, PubMed always includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms for the MeSH term and also includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader Subheadings. The broader Subheading, or one of its indentions, will be directly attached to the MeSH term or one of its indentions. For example, hypertension/therapy also retrieves hypertension/diet therapy; hypertension/drug therapy; hypertension, malignant/therapy; hypertension, malignant/drug therapy, and so on, as well as hypertension/therapy.\nTo turn off the automatic inclusion of the more specific terms, use the syntax [field:noexp], e.g., hypertension [mh:noexp], or hypertension [majr:noexp], or hypertension/therapy [mh:noexp]. The latter example turns off the more specific terms in both parts, searching for only the one Subheading therapy attached directly to only the one MeSH term hypertension.\nIf parentheses are embedded in a MeSH term, replace the parentheses with a space and tag with [mh] e.g., enter the MeSH term Benzo(a)pyrene as benzo a pyrene [mh].\nMeSH terms can be selected for searching in the MeSH database and from the advanced search builder index.\n\nModification Date [lr]\nModification date is a completed citation’s most recent revision date. Modification Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [lr] search tag is required.\nNLM Unique ID [jid]\nThe NLM ID is the alpha-numeric identifier for the cited journal that was assigned by the NLM Integrated Library System LocatorPlus, e.g., 0375267 [jid].\nOther Term [ot]\nThe author keyword field (OT field) is searchable with the title/abstract [tiab], text word [tw] and other term [ot] search tags. To retrieve all citations that have keywords, use the query haskeyword. Other term data may display an asterisk to indicate a major concept; however, you cannot search other terms with a major concept tag.\nOwner\nThe owner search field includes the acronym that identifies the organization that supplied the citation data. Search using owner + the owner acronym, e.g., ownernasa.\nPagination [pg]\nEnter only the first page number that the article appears on. The citation will display the full pagination of the article but this field is searchable using only the first page number.\nPersonal Name as Subject [ps]\nUse this search field tag to limit retrieval to where the name is the subject of the article, e.g., varmus h[ps]. Search for personal names as subject using the author field format, e.g., varmus h[ps].\nPharmacological Action [pa]\nSubstances known to have a particular pharmacologic action. Each pharmacologic action term index is created with the drug/substance terms known to have that effect. This includes both MeSH terms and terms for Supplementary Concept Records.\nPlace of Publication [pl]\nIndicates the cited journal's country of publication. Geographic place of publication regions are not searchable. In order to retrieve records for all countries in a region (e.g., North America) it is necessary to OR together the countries of interest. Note: This field is not included in all fields or text word retrieval.\nPMCID and MID\nSearch for PMC or NIH manuscript identifiers using the appropriate prefix followed by the ID number, e.g., PMC2600426. To retrieve all NIH manuscript citations, use the query hasnihmsid.\nPMID [pmid]\nTo search for a PubMed Identifier (PMID), enter the ID with or without the search field tag [pmid]. You can search for several PMIDs by entering each number in the search box separated by a space (e.g., 17170002 16381840); PubMed will OR the PMIDs together.\nPMIDs do not change over time or during processing and are never reused.\nPublication Date [dp]\nPublication date is the date that the article was published. The search field tags [dp] and [pdat] may be used interchangeably for publication date searching.\nDates or date ranges must be searched using the format yyyy/mm/dd [dp], e.g., 1998/03/06 [dp]. The month and day are optional (e.g., 1998 [dp] or 1998/03 [dp]).\nTo enter a date range search, insert a colon (:) between each date, e.g., 1996:1998 [dp] or 1998/01:1998/04 [dp].\nUse the following format to search X days, months or years immediately preceding today’s date where X = numeric value:\n\n\"last X days\"[dp]\n\"last X months\"[dp]\n\"last X year\"[dp]\n\nMore information about publication dates:\n\nThe time between an article’s publication and the citation’s availability in PubMed varies depending on when the publisher deposits the citation to PubMed. Because of this, searching with Create Date [crdt] (the date a citation was created in PubMed) is often more comprehensive than Publication Date [dp] when checking PubMed on a regular basis for new citations.\nJournals vary in the way the publication date appears on an issue. Some journals include just the year, whereas others include the year plus month or year plus month plus day. And, some journals use the year and season (e.g., Winter 1997). The publication date in the citation is recorded as it appears in the journal.\nPublication dates without a month are set to January, multiple months (e.g., Oct-Dec) are set to the first month, and dates without a day are set to the first day of the month. Dates with a season are set as: winter = January, spring = April, summer = July and fall = October.\nIf an article is published electronically and in print on different dates both dates are searchable and may be included on the citation prefaced with an Epub or Print label. The electronic date will not be searchable if it is later than the print date, except when range searching.\nTo search for electronic dates only use the search tag [EPDAT], for print dates only tag with [PPDAT].\nMost journals now publish articles online on a continuous basis, as soon as they are ready for publication (after peer review and editing, etc.) instead of, or in addition to, publishing collections of articles as an \"issue\" on a periodic basis. When a journal deposits a citation for an \"online first\" article in PubMed, NLM appends the note \"[Online ahead of print]\" to the online publication date. The citation is updated, and the ahead of print notation removed, when the article is included in a journal issue. The lag between the \"online first\" and \"issue\" publication dates may be days, weeks, months, or more than a year. In many cases, depending on the journal, the online first version is considered to be the version of record. The \"[Online ahead of print]\" note in PubMed should not be taken to mean that the cited article is not the version of record.\nBookshelf citation publication dates are generated from the book’s original publication date. Publication date searches include Contribution Date (CTDT) and Date Revised (DRDT) in addition to Publication Date (DP) for Book citations.\n\nPublication Type [pt]\nDescribes the material presented in the article (e.g., Review, Clinical Trial, Retracted Publication, Letter). Citations may include multiple Publication Types. Use the search tag [pt] with any PubMed Publication Type, e.g., review[pt].\nPublication Types are arranged hierarchically with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms, and publication types automatically include the more specific publication types in a search. To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [pt:noexp], e.g., review [pt:noexp].\nPublisher [pubn]\nIncludes publisher names for Bookshelf citations.\nSecondary Source ID [si]\nThe SI field identifies secondary source databanks and accession numbers, e.g., GenBank, GEO, PubChem, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN. The field is composed of the source followed by a slash followed by an accession number and can be searched with one or both components, e.g., genbank [si], AF001892 [si], genbank/AF001892 [si]. To retrieve all citations with an SI value, search hasdatabanklist.\nSubset [sb]\nThe subset field is a method of restricting retrieval by subject, citation status and journal category, with the search tag [SB]. See also filters and Find related resources using LinkOut.\nSupplementary Concept [nm]\nIncludes chemical, protocol, disease or organism terms. Synonyms to the supplementary concepts will automatically map when tagged with [nm]. This field was implemented in mid-1980; however, many chemical names are searchable as MeSH terms before that date.\nText Words [tw]\nIncludes all words and numbers in the title, abstract, other abstract, MeSH terms, MeSH Subheadings, Publication Types, Substance Names, Personal Name as Subject, Corporate Author, Secondary Source, Comment/Correction Notes, and Other Terms (see Other Term [OT] above) typically non-MeSH subject terms (keywords), including NASA Space Flight Mission, assigned by an organization other than NLM.\nTitle [ti]\nWords and numbers included in the title of a citation, as well as the collection title for book citations.\nTitle/Abstract [tiab]\nWords and numbers included in a citation's title, collection title, abstract, other abstract and author keywords (Other Term [ot] field). English language abstracts are taken directly from the published article. If an article does not have a published abstract, NLM does not create one.\nTransliterated Title [tt]\nWords and numbers in title originally published in a non-English language, in that language. Non-Roman alphabet language titles are transliterated. Transliterated title is not included in Text Word [TW] retrieval.\nVolume [vi]\nThe number of the journal volume in which an article is published.\nNLM author indexing policy\nNLM author indexing policy is as follows:\n\n1966 - 1984: MEDLINE did not limit the number of authors.\n1984 - 1995: The NLM limited the number of authors to 10, with \"et al\" as the eleventh occurrence.\n1996 - 1999: The NLM increased the limit from 10 to 25. If there were more than 25 authors, the first 24 were listed, the last author was used as the 25th, and the twenty-sixth and beyond became \"et al.\"\n2000 - Present: MEDLINE does not limit the number of authors.\n\nMore information:\n\nBeginning in mid-2005, the policy restrictions on number of author names in past years were lifted so that on an individual basis, a citation may be edited to include all author names in the published article, regardless of the limitation in effect when the citation was created.\nEffective with 1992 date of publication, letters are indexed individually with authors rather than as an anonymous group.\nUntil 1990, NLM transliterated up to five authors' Cyrillic or Japanese names to the Roman alphabet.\nBetween 1990 and 2016, the first ten Cyrillic or Japanese names are transliterated. Chinese ideograms were not transliterated by NLM, but if transliterations of the authors names are available in the journal article or table of contents, they were included in the citation, even if that includes only one author in a multi-author article.\nBeginning in 2016, author names are published in Roman characters in all MEDLINE journals, and NLM no longer transliterates Cyrillic or Japanese names. All author names are included as published.\n\nError messages\nSystem error messages\nPlease provide your IT staff with the technical browser advice for NCBI web pages to ensure your browser, firewall, and servers are enabled for JavaScript, cookies, pop-ups, and HTTP 1.1. Antivirus software may affect page caching which can result in unexpected page expired messages. Also, nlm.nih.gov should be added as a browser exception and be considered a trusted site by your system and network. You may have to delete your browser's cache (temporary files) before trying to access PubMed again.\nTypographical errors\nPlease contact the journal publisher directly to report an error and initiate a correction to PubMed citations for content other than MeSH.\nTo report a MeSH error in a PubMed citation, please contact the NLM Help Desk and include the PMID number (e.g., PMID: 12345678), and an indication of the incorrect and correct information.\nNLM provides data to vendors around the world. Other products and services will not necessarily immediately reflect corrections made to PubMed records. If you search through a vendor's system, please contact your vendor about their maintenance schedules.\nCookies\nA \"cookie\" is information stored by a web site server on your computer.

The similarity between documents is measured by the words they have in common, with some adjustment for document lengths. To carry out such a program, one must first define what a word is. For us, a word is basically an unbroken string of letters and numerals with at least one letter of the alphabet in it. Words end at hyphens, spaces, new lines, and punctuation. The 132 common, but uninformative, words (also known as stopwords) are eliminated from processing at this stage. Next, a limited amount of stemming of words is done, but no thesaurus is used in processing. Words from the abstract of a document are classified as text words. Words from titles are also classified as text words, but words from titles are added in a second time to give them a small advantage in the local weighting scheme. MeSH terms are placed in a third category, and a MeSH term with a subheading qualifier is entered twice, once without the qualifier and once with it. If a MeSH term is starred (indicating a major concept in a document), the star is ignored. These three categories of words (or phrases in the case of MeSH) comprise the representation of a document. No other fields, such as Author or Journal, enter into the calculations.\nHaving obtained the set of terms that represent each document, the next step is to recognize that not all words are of equal value. Each time a word is used, it is assigned a numerical weight. This numerical weight is based on information that the computer can obtain by automatic processing. Automatic processing is important because the number of different terms that have to be assigned weights is close to two million for this system. The weight or value of a term is dependent on three types of information: 1) the number of different documents in the database that contain the term; 2) the number of times the term occurs in a particular document; and 3) the number of term occurrences in the document. The first of these pieces of information is used to produce a number called the global weight of the term. The global weight is used in weighting the term throughout the database. The second and third pieces of information pertain only to a particular document and are used to produce a number called the local weight of the term in that specific document. When a word occurs in two documents, its weight is computed as the product of the global weight times the two local weights (one pertaining to each of the documents).\nThe global weight of a term is greater for the less frequent terms. This is reasonable because the presence of a term that occurred in most of the documents would really tell one very little about a document. On the other hand, a term that occurred in only 100 documents of one million would be very helpful in limiting the set of documents of interest. A word that occurred in only 10 documents is likely to be even more informative and will receive an even higher weight.\nThe local weight of a term is the measure of its importance in a particular document. Generally, the more frequent a term is within a document, the more important it is in representing the content of that document. However, this relationship is saturating, i.e., as the frequency continues to go up, the importance of the word increases less rapidly and finally comes to a finite limit. In addition, we do not want a longer document to be considered more important just because it is longer; therefore, a length correction is applied. This local weight computation is based on the Poisson distribution and the formula can be found in Lin J and Wilbur WJ.\nThe similarity between two documents is computed by adding up the weights (local wt1 × local wt2 × global wt) of all of the terms the two documents have in common. This provides an indication of how related two documents are. The resultant score is an example of a vector score. Vector scoring was originated by Gerard Salton and has a long history in text retrieval. The interested reader is referred to Salton, Automatic Text Processing, Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1989 for further information on this topic. Our approach differs from other approaches in the way we calculate the local weights for the individual terms. Once the similarity score of a document in relation to each of the other documents in the database has been computed, that document's neighbors are identified as the most similar (highest scoring) documents found. These closely related documents are pre-computed for each document in PubMed so that when you select Similar articles, the system has only to retrieve this list. This enables a fast response time for such queries.\nJournal lists\nPubMed journals\n\nUncompressed\nGNU zip\nUNIX Compress\nPKZIP\n\nPubMed and NCBI molecular biology database journals\n\nUncompressed\nGNU zip\nUNIX Compress\nPKZIP\n\nBack to Top\nNCBI Literature Resources\nMeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

It is vital that projects appropriately credit information obtained from the works of other authors. In addition to the obvious and manifest reason of maintaining the highest standards of honesty and integrity in scientific research, there are several practical reasons for maintaining high standards in this area. This chapter also discusses when to reference and when not to reference. Original research and ideas do not need to be cited, as they were conceived and gathered by the researcher. But when ideas and research from another source are used, it is important to cite that source and to give credit to the original author. The following situations generally require some form of citation. It is appropriate at times to use information from other sources without having to cite it as one's own work. Commonly known facts, such as the name of the first president of the United States, and facts that can be found within multiple sources, such as Asia being the world's largest continent, fall into this category. Authors should use their judgment as to what information should and should not be cited and be prepared to be questioned by editors on this subject.\nRecommended articles\nReferences (0)\nCited by (0)\nView full text\nCopyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Dyspepsia does not include heartburn (a retrosternal burning sensation); although heartburn is often present in addition to dyspeptic symptoms, it cannot be the dominant problem.\n\nCauses and PathogenesisTop\n\n1. Undiagnosed dyspepsia: Patients presenting with dyspepsia symptoms that have not had investigations to determine whether the cause is organic or functional.\n\n2. Organic dyspepsia occurs in the presence of an established organic, systemic, or metabolic cause with symptom resolution or improvement after resolution of the underlying condition: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); drug-induced gastric, duodenal, or esophageal mucosal injury (acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], certain oral antibiotics [mainly doxycycline, erythromycin, ampicillin], digitalis, theophylline, iron or potassium salts, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, glucocorticoids, bisphosphonates); peptic ulcer disease; diseases of the biliary system; hepatitis; pancreatitis; pancreatic pseudocysts; malignancy (gastric, pancreatic, colorectal); intestinal ischemia; and abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n3. Functional dyspepsia: Dyspepsia lasting ≥3 months (with onset of symptoms ≥6 months prior to diagnosis) with no organic cause identified on upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Symptoms do not resolve on bowel movement and are not associated with changes in the frequency of bowel movements or the appearance of stool (features of irritable bowel syndrome).Functional dyspepsia may be categorized as postprandial distress syndrome (early satiety and fullness) or epigastric pain syndrome that may occur irrespective of meals.\n\nDiagnosisTop\n\n1. History and physical examination: Determine:\n\n1) How long the symptoms have been present.\n\n2) Whether they are accompanied by bloating (this may suggest IBS) or heartburn and regurgitation of acid (suggestive of GERD).\n\n3) Whether the frequency of bowel movements and stool consistency are normal (any abnormalities and resolution of pain after bowel movements are suggestive of IBS).\n\n4) What medications the patient is taking (identify drugs that cause dyspepsia, particularly NSAIDs).\n\n5) Whether there are any alarming symptoms, or red flags (unintended weight loss, abdominal pain waking the patient, jaundice, GI bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, recurrent vomiting, epigastric mass).\n\n2. Diagnostic studies: Perform the following to confirm or exclude an organic cause:\n\n1) Complete blood count (CBC) (iron deficiency anemia is a red flag suggestive of an organic cause).\n\n2) Abdominal ultrasonography (to be performed in patients with red flags).\n\n3) Upper GI endoscopy (not always necessary but usually warranted in patients aged ≥60 years in areas of low risk of gastric cancer and younger ages in countries where gastric cancer is more common. Red flags may prompt endoscopy in younger age groups but this depends on the concern regarding cancer. For example, a 5-kg weight loss may not be of a major concern in a 20-year-old patient with dyspepsia but it may prompt endoscopy in a 55-year-old person.\n\nManagementTop\n\n1. Undiagnosed dyspepsia: A noninvasive test for Helicobacter pylori followed by treatment if infected (see Peptic Ulcer Disease) is the recommended approach for young patients with dyspepsia. If the patient is H pylori–negative or does not respond to successful eradication therapy, then empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be offered. Endoscopy should not be done routinely in young patients with dyspepsia. The definition of “young” will vary by country according to gastric cancer risk. In low-risk countries endoscopy is not necessary in those <60 years of age.\n\n2. Organic dyspepsia: Treat the underlying condition and, if possible, discontinue the drugs that cause dyspepsia. In patients with coexisting heartburn and dyspepsia, the preliminary diagnosis is GERD, and empiric treatment with PPIs is started (agents and dosage: see Peptic Ulcer Disease). If dyspepsia persists despite appropriate treatment, GERD is an unlikely diagnosis. Of note, some European experts include a positive H pylori status among causes of organic dyspepsia.\n\n3. Functional dyspepsia: By definition, if the patient has had an endoscopy and histology, they should have H pylori testing. If the test result is positive, start eradication therapy (see Peptic Ulcer Disease). If the test is negative or eradication therapy fails, treat the patient with a PPI. You may try amitriptyline 10 to 25 mg taken at bedtime for 8 to 12 weeks (if effective, continue for ~6 months). Instruct the patient to stop smoking, avoid foods and drinks that cause or worsen the symptoms, and eat frequent small meals. Prokinetic therapy, such as domperidone, may be tried if available in the country of practice. Psychotherapy may also be useful.\n\nWe would love to hear from you\n\nComments, mistakes, suggestions?\n\nSocial Media\n\nWe use cookies to ensure you get the best browsing experience on our website.

Partner influence was also dynamic and iterative, taking different forms over the course of the study. Across studies, we identified 387 discrete examples of influence and classified each as one of five types of influence, derived inductively from the interview data: co-producing, redirecting, refining, confirming, and limited. Most projects exhibited multiple types of influence, with 50 researchers and 41 partners reporting two or more types of influence within a project. Of the 387 examples of stakeholder influence, 306 had at least one reported impact on the study. Such impacts included changes to reflect the needs and preferences of patients or clinicians, as well as impacts on study feasibility, study quality, engagement scope or quality, and study relevance. Both researchers and partners identified multiple types of impact within projects, with 42 researchers and 38 partners reporting two or more types within a project. Because of these observable impacts, researchers and partners described engagement as worthwhile.\nConclusions\nFindings provide insights for funders and institutions supporting engagement, measurement efforts, and clinical researchers aiming to conduct engaged research and observe similar influences and impacts in their own studies.\nKEY WORDS: patient and stakeholder engagement, comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, patient and public involvement\nINTRODUCTION\nA growing body of evidence is resolving early questions concerning the feasibility and value of engaging patients and other stakeholders in the clinical research process. Engaging stakeholders promotes inclusion and partnership with individuals who bring unique perspectives and hold a direct interest in research findings. Early studies demonstrate that stakeholders engaged as research partners have influenced study protocols and study enrollment rates.1–5 These contributions by stakeholder partners have resulted in impacts to studies’ acceptability, feasibility, rigor, and relevance.6\nMuch of the initial discovery about how patients and other stakeholder partners impact research has been based on open-ended survey responses, study reports, or publications that included varying, researcher-generated, or nominal information about engagement. More detailed descriptions of how stakeholders influence the research process, the specific ways in which that influence affects the planning and conduct of a study, and the contributing factors and approaches to engagement that determine the nature of influence that stakeholders might have would strengthen this knowledge base. Such information can bring a deeper understanding of the specific benefits of patient and other stakeholder engagement in health research and can offer greater specificity to clinical researchers wishing to engage stakeholders.\nTo advance understanding of how engagement influences the research process, we report findings from in-depth interviews with researchers and partners. Research questions were as follows: (1) How did engagement influence the planning and conduct of studies? (2) What impacts on the study resulted from that influence? We defined influence as the contributions of partners in terms of behaviors, decisions, or events within individual studies. We defined impact as the results of those contributions on the study design and conduct. We conducted interviews with individuals from a diverse sample of studies from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) research portfolio. PCORI requires awardees to engage diverse stakeholders in comparative effectiveness research studies. Awardees have used a wide array of engagement practices, implemented with varied intensity ranging from input to consultation to collaboration to shared leadership.4,6,7 Consequently, this shared context in PCORI-funded studies provides a rich opportunity to describe the influence and impact of engagement on research.\nMETHODS\nWe designed a systematic study using qualitative methods because of the need for in-depth information on influence and impact of engagement. To ensure that this work was fully informed by stakeholders, PCORI’s Advisory Panel on Patient Engagement provided input throughout all stages of the study. The American Institutes for Research’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed the protocol.\nSample\nWe used purposeful sampling to achieve heterogeneous representation of PCORI’s portfolio in terms of study completion status (i.e., complete and active), funding announcement category, PCORI priority content area, study design, study populations, and health conditions.8,9 Active studies were eligible if they had completed at least one contract year. To optimize the chance that interview participants could speak to engagement’s influence, we prioritized studies whose principal investigators (PIs) reported in the PCORI-collected survey and administrative data that partner influence had occurred or that they had engaged different types of stakeholders across multiple study phases. From 301 eligible studies, we identified 80 for inclusion and emailed PIs requesting participation. We asked PIs to share contact information for study partners, whom we contacted separately to request participation.\nThe final sample comprised 58 studies. We conducted 109 interviews with 58 researchers (PIs and/or their designee from the research team) and 51 partners. Table 1 shows study and participant characteristics. Seven studies did not include a partner interview because of partner death, time since study conclusion, language preference, or lack of response to the request for contact information. Partner interviews represented a diversity of perspectives, with 21 (41%) identifying solely as patients or caregivers.\nTable 1.\nSample description\n| Characteristic | Number (%) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Studies (n\\=58) |\n| Completion status |\n|  Active | 39 (67%) |\n| PCORI funding announcement type |\n|  Broad (investigator-initiated applications for patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research aligned with priority areas) | 31 (53%) |\n|  Pragmatic (applications for pragmatic clinical trials, large simple trials, or large-scale observational studies) | 11 (19%) |\n|  Targeted (one-time opportunity applications on specific, high-impact topics selected in response to input from patients and other stakeholders) | 16 (28%) |\n| PCORI priority content area |\n|  Addressing disparities | 15 (26%) |\n|  Assessment of prevention, diagnosis and treatment options | 15 (26%) |\n|  Communication and dissemination research | 8 (14%) |\n|  Improving healthcare systems | 20 (34%) |\n| Study design |\n|  Experimental | 46 (79%) |\n|  Observational | 8 (14%) |\n|  Quasi-experimental | 4 (7%) |\n| Researcher interviews (n\\=58) |\n|  Principal investigator alone | 28 (48%) |\n|  Principal investigator designee alone* | 7 (12%) |\n|  Principal investigator plus other team member | 23 (40%) |\n| Partner interview participant roles (n\\=51) |\n|  Patient or caregiver | 21 (41%) |\n|  Patient advocates or members of health or patient advocacy organizations | 11 (21%) |\n|  Clinicians | 4 (8%) |\n|  Subject matter experts | 3 (6%) |\n|  Engagement specialists | 2 (4%) |\n|  Representatives of community-based organizations | 2 (4%) |\n|  Multiple roles | 8 (16%) |\nOpen in a new tab\n*The principal investigator requested that the project director or co-investigator complete the interview on their behalf\nData Collection\nWe developed semi-structured interview protocols for hour-long interviews conducted between June 2018 and January 2019 in English by phone or video. Interviews focused on eliciting examples of partners’ influence during the study—including roles and responsibilities, behaviors, and contributions to decision making—and how engagement affected the design or conduct of the study. Interview protocols included questions about positive impacts to the study as well as unintended, undesirable, and negative impacts. Two teams of four experienced qualitative researchers interviewed researchers and partners, respectively. All were previously familiar with engagement in comparative effectiveness research. To prepare for interviews, interviewers studied available study publications and awardee reports to PCORI and then tailored interview protocols accordingly.\nAnalysis\nTo understand the data from different perspectives and triangulate findings, we used multiple types of analysis: coding, structured memos, and content and thematic analysis of a catalog of examples.\nCoding and Memoing\nAll interviews were professionally transcribed and uploaded into NVivo 12 qualitative data analysis software. Five analysts coded the data using a codebook that initially included deductive codes based on the interview protocol and attributes of the interview participant and study (e.g., interview type, health condition). Analysts applied these deductive codes and added open codes to label examples of influence. Then, analysts wrote a structured memo for each study summarizing content related to the research questions and identified quotes from both researcher and partner interviews reflecting concrete influences and impacts of engagement.\nCataloging Examples of Influence and Associated Impacts\nWe used content analysis techniques to identify concrete, discrete examples of influence in coded data and catalog them.10 For each example, we developed a descriptive label reflecting the main idea (e.g., partners proposed an outcome measure, partners led recruitment activity), selected illustrative quotes, identified the study phase when it occurred, and what impact, if any, resulted. We then assigned each example to one of five types of influence stakeholders exerted, which were developed inductively from a preliminary analysis of the first 24 completed summary memos and refined using the remaining transcripts. After cataloging all examples, two analysts independently reviewed the set of examples to confirm or challenge the influence type assignments. When analysts did not agree, they met to refine definitions and reach agreement on the best fit.\nWe also assigned each example to one or more types of impact on the study as applicable, starting with four previously identified types of impacts: study acceptability, feasibility, rigor, and relevance.6 We used a similar process of assigning, reviewing, and coming to agreement on examples while also inductively revising the types of impact to better reflect the interview data.\nAnalysis and Synthesis\nAnalysts met weekly to discuss observations, identify thematic and content patterns in the interviews, and iteratively synthesize findings across code output, summary memos, and the catalog of examples to identify patterns of overlap and divergence, explore relationships among concepts, and identify cross-cutting themes.\nRESULTS\nFor each research question, we identified three cross-cutting themes, which are described in the text with additional examples and illustrative quotes included in tables. Unless otherwise noted, themes were consistent across interview participant type (i.e., researchers, partners) and study characteristics (e.g., study design, PCORI content area, health condition focus).\nHow Did Engagement Influence the Planning and Conduct of PCORI-Funded Studies?\nAcross the 58 studies, we cataloged 387 discrete examples of influence—250 from researcher interviews and 137 from partner interviews. Researchers from all studies reported at least one example. Two partners could recall engagement activities generally but could not recall specific examples of influence. Across the examples, interview participants described involvement by a variety of partners, including patients, caregivers, representatives from professional and patient and consumer advocacy organizations, clinicians, payers, healthcare administrators, and other staff at healthcare settings such as office managers or staff who work with electronic health records. The number and types of partners involved varied, with some studies including multiple types of partners and others including one or two types.\nDescribed as an Integral, Long-term Part of the Research Process, Engagement Influenced All Aspects of the Design and Execution of Studies\nInterview participants talked about engagement as part of the overall process that shaped the study design and conduct. The examples of influence spanned study phases and activities from designing the study to disseminating study findings. Table 2 highlights examples for each activity, such as co-writing the proposal, developing new survey items, enrolling study participants, and contributing to manuscripts. Partners influenced how researchers conceptualized the study, executed study tasks, and communicated about the study to both study participants and external audiences. Partners also addressed study-related challenges, such as issues with recruitment or low retention. In addition, different partners could be involved at different times during the study. For example, clinicians could be involved during data collection, while patients were involved during study design discussions or dissemination.\nTable 2.\nExamples of partner influence showing how engagement was integral to all study activities\n| Study activity | Examples of partner influence |\n| --- | --- |\n| Research questions and plans | • Co-developed the study in initial project phases\n• Collaborated with researchers to determine priorities and suitable research questions\n• Co-wrote proposal for project funding\n• Confirmed that the study was important, feasible, timely, or worthwhile\n|\n| Study design | • Discussed iteratively potential designs and endpoints\n• Adapted study design to address challenges and obstacles prior or during implementation\n• Identified weaknesses in the proposed design and helped determine how to address them\n• Challenged the use of a randomized controlled trial study design because partners wanted all patients to receive the benefits of the intervention\n• Helped determine inclusion/exclusion criteria by suggesting expansion of age range, diagnostic criteria, or additional groups (e.g., rural)\n• Agreed with and validated aspects of the study design\n|\n| Outcome and measurement approaches | • Disputed research team’s choices and proposed alternatives for study outcomes\n• Helped to prioritize among desirable outcomes to study\n• Identified gaps in available instruments and new or additional domains for inclusion\n• Developed new surveys or survey items\n• Advised on the content or phrasing of surveys or survey items\n• Tested candidate instruments\n• Evaluated the feasibility, usability, and burden of selected measures\n|\n| Intervention design and implementation | • Influenced the content and format of intervention materials (e.g., videos, apps, websites) by adding or removing content, making language patient-friendly, or making materials easier to use in the field or doctor’s office\n• Adapted interventions to fit study sites, clinic workflow, or patient experience\n• Trained intervention providers\n• Led intervention activities\n|\n| Recruitment and enrollment processes and materials | • Conducted outreach activities to sites and patients\n• Created flyers, letters, and informed consent materials\n• Advised and cautioned researchers how content, messaging, or language might be misinterpreted during recruitment\n• Edited materials to make them shorter and clearer and improve cultural appropriateness\n• Enrolled patients in the study\n|\n| Retention approaches | • Conducted retention activities, such as follow-up phone calls\n• Developed strategies for encouraging retention\n• Suggested adding incentives to prevent attrition\n• Created or directed the creation of tools to engage study participants, such as a newsletter or a Facebook group\n|\n| Data collection | • Conducted interviews\n• Provided technical assistance to study sites\n• Facilitated communication between sites and researchers\n|\n| Data analysis | • Supplied context to explain study results\n• Offered alternate interpretations of study results\n• Suggested conducting additional analyses\n|\n| Dissemination | • Brainstormed and planned for dissemination, including offering advice on vehicles\n• Created dissemination products, such as presentations or manuscripts\n• Participated in dissemination activities\n|\n| Engagement | • Designed or led engagement\n• Developed or requested alternative engagement strategies\n• Created written guidance and tools to support engagement\n• Suggested and recruited new partners\n|\nOpen in a new tab\nPartner Influence Was Dynamic, Non-linear, and Iterative, Taking Different Forms over the Course of the Study\nWe identified five types of influence that described how partners exerted influence, listed in order of prevalence:\n\n\nRedirecting: Partners shift the study’s direction or suggesting new plans or materials, such as different outcome measures or expanded sampling parameters.\n\n\nCo-producing: Partners and researchers work together or collaborate, including co-conceptualizing the study design, co-executing study tasks, or having partners lead tasks.\n\n\nRefining: Partners edit or modify existing plans or materials, such as recruitment materials or manuscripts.\n\n\nLimited or no influence: Influence was constrained or did not occur because researchers were not able to implement partner suggestions (e.g., due to institutional review board constraints); researchers encountered challenges balancing stakeholder influence with science best practices; researchers did not ask for or apply partner input; or partners felt they did not have much input to offer.\n\n\nConfirming: Partners validate existing plans or materials.\n\n\nTable 3 provides examples of each type of influence and the frequency of reports by interview participants. Table 5 highlights an illustrative quote for each type.\nTable 3.\nThe dynamic influence of engagement on PCORI-funded research: definitions, examples, and frequency of types of influence by researcher and partner interview participants\n| Types | Examples | Frequency of report |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Researcher, n\\=58 | Partner, n\\=51 | Total, n\\=109 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Redirecting: Partners shift the study’s direction or create new plans or materials | • Disputed research team’s choices and proposed alternatives for outcomes or measures\n• Recommended different recruitment strategies\n• Suggested new avenues for dissemination\n| 39 (67%) | 42 (82%) | 81 (74%) |\n| Co-producing: Partners and researchers work together or collaborate | • Approached researchers with study idea\n• Developed the intervention for the study\n• Led study recruitment\n| 42 (72%) | 33 (65%) | 75 (69%) |\n| Refining: Partners edit or modify existing plans or material | • Edited study materials or manuscripts\n• Suggested improvements to study implementation procedures\n| 47 (81%) | 24 (47%) | 71 (65%) |\n| Limited or no influence: Researchers were unable to implement partner suggestions | • IRB constraints limited ability to implement suggestions\n• Researchers decided not to implement\n• Partners felt they did not have much to contribute\n| 20 (34%) | 16 (31%) | 36 (33%) |\n| Confirming: Partners validate existing plans or materials | • Validated that study aims were important\n• Reviewed study recruitment materials\n| 8 (14%) | 4 (8%) | 12 (11%) |\nOpen in a new tab\nNote: Types of influence listed in order of frequency of report (i.e., total number of researchers and partners who reported it)\nTable 5.\nIllustrative quotes for types of engagement influence and impact\n| Type | Illustrative quote |\n| --- | --- |\n| Influence |\n| Redirecting | “People had problems with [blood samples being sent away for analysis]. They didn’t want to have their blood go out from their community. Based on the suggestion from …the advisory panel, we decided that we will work with the local health services where they will do the lab work.” (Researcher) |\n| Co-producing | “From the very first glimmer, I was involved. We sketched out what a trial would look like together and wrote the grant together.” (Partner) |\n| Refining | “We were missing eligible patients because of a [four-week screening] window. All these clinicians realized that and said, ‘let’s change the protocol.’ And we did make that window bigger.” (Researcher) |\n| Limited or no influence | “We had an online platform that we wish we would have had a little more involvement with the development, because it was an issue with a lot of our patients using that platform.” (Partner) |\n| Confirming | “It was a complicated study. When we initially came up with the idea, we weren’t sure that it was even going to be feasible. But after again engaging the stakeholders…we were reassured and encouraged to move forward with it.” (Researcher) |\n| Impact |\n| User-centeredness and acceptability | “Another challenge [the researchers had was] making this questionnaire user-friendly, not asking too invasive questions … we gave them suggestions from a patient standpoint.” (Partner) |\n| Study feasibility | “The survey questionnaires were coming in at a slower pace than what the researchers wanted… [After we gave our suggestions], they realized a huge difference. They mentioned something like 80, 90 percent [up] from 50 percent.” (Partner) |\n| Study quality | “The stakeholders gave us insights and suggestions that we probably wouldn’t have come up with on our own that in the end improved the trial design, trial implementation, and, hopefully, will give us the most meaningful results.” (Researcher) |\n| Engagement scope and quality | “We worked together and created a patient partner guide and a handbook and a glossary … It’s something that we will have to continue to refine and change to make it as user friendly as possible.” (Partner) |\n| Relevance | “We published an article that documented the results of our focus groups and key informant interviews with patients and caregivers, and through their [partners] assistance, we ended up getting an Altmetric score that placed us in the top 5% of all medical articles published….I attribute it to what they did.” (Researcher) |\nOpen in a new tab\nThe number of types of influences per study ranged from one to five, with 50 researchers and 41 partners reporting two or more types of influence within a single study. Sometimes, these influences were iterative, driving a cycle of influence where redirecting could lead to later refining or confirming. For example, in one study, early redirection by stakeholders resulted in a well-planned data collection protocol that required minimal refinement prior to implementation.\nPartners Influenced Studies by Teaching Researchers About Patients’ Lives or How Other Stakeholders Carry Out Their Work\nFor example, partners taught researchers about what life is like for people with depression or what clinic workflow is like for a doctor. One researcher said:\n\n[Partners are] a component to understanding the experience of the patient, how doctors perceive what we’re trying to do, how best to reach them, how best to get in touch with them…how we’re actually going to roll this out at the end of the project. It’s something—you can’t really do in a vacuum.\n\nAnother said, “We originally anticipated approaching and trying to recruit patients in-person...But what we learned in talking with this clinic was that many of their patients are farmers that live two and three hours away.”\nThis teaching could result in any type of influence from redirecting to confirming. Researchers responded by making changes, such as to data collection procedures, even when partners were not directly involved in that part of the study. Researchers even mentioned longer-term changes, such as changing their approach to research and altering priorities for future studies.\nWhat Impacts on the Study Resulted from that Influence?\nOf the 387 influence examples, 306 had at least one identifiable impact on the study—208 from researcher interviews and 98 from partner interviews.\nResearchers and Partners Reported that Engaging Patients and Other Stakeholders Had a Multi-faceted Impact on Study Planning and Conduct\nIn one example, a researcher summarized the multiple impacts as follows: “The study got done. We exceeded expectations…We recruited more than we expected, we enrolled more than we expected. It was phenomenal from that frame.”\nFrom the examples, we identified five types of impact, listed in order of prevalence:\n\n\nUser-centeredness and acceptability: How well the study design and study materials reflected the needs and preferences of patients, providers, or other partners\n\n\nStudy feasibility: How well the team was able to execute study activities in a timely, cost-effective way\n\n\nStudy quality: Changes to quality of study design (e.g., comprehensiveness, rigor) and study materials\n\n\nEngagement scope and quality: How well the study engaged diverse stakeholders across study activities\n\n\nRelevance: Usefulness of study results to intended audiences\n\n\nTable 4 provides examples for each type and frequency of report by interview participants. Table 5 highlights an illustrative quote for each type of impact.\nTable 4.\nHow engagement shapes PCORI-funded studies: definitions, examples, and frequency of types of impact reported by researcher and partner interview participants\n| Types | Examples | Frequency of report |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Researcher,\nn\\=58 | Partner,\nn\\=51 | Total,\nn\\=109 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| User-centeredness and acceptability: How well the study and study materials reflected the needs and preferences of patients, providers, or other partners | • Prioritized outcomes that matter to patients\n• Reduced burden for study site staff\n• Reflected user preferences for study implementation\n• Address lack of interest from patient populations or sites\n| 54 (93%) | 44(86%) | 98 (90%) |\n| Study feasibility: How well the team was able to execute study activities in a timely, cost-effective way | • Improved ability to collect data\n• Improved recruitment process and materials\n• Changes to project management, such as increasing or decreasing costs\n| 41 (70%) | 32 (55%) | 73 (67%) |\n| Study quality: Changes to quality of study design and study materials | • Improved study’s comprehensiveness\n• Changes to rigor of study design\n• Improved quality of intervention materials\n| 43 (74%) | 27 (53%) | 70 (64%) |\n| Engagement scope and quality: How well the study engaged diverse stakeholders across study activities | • Improved representation by expanding the number or types of stakeholders involved\n• Improved engagement processes\n| 22 (38%) | 11 (21%) | 33 (30%) |\n| Relevance: Usefulness of study results to intended audiences | • Validated that study aims and outcomes were important and meaningful\n• Increased receptivity of study findings\n| 10 (17%) | 2 (4%) | 12 (11%) |\nOpen in a new tab\nNote: Types of impact listed in order of frequency of report (i.e., total number of researchers and partners who reported it)\nThe number of reported impacts per project ranged from one to five, with 42 researchers and 38 partners specifying two or more types of impact within a project. Most reported impacts affected the study in ways that researchers and partners wanted. For example, partner input improved enrollment or the study’s comprehensiveness. However, a few examples resulted in undesirable impacts such as increased costs or delays. In these instances, researchers described needing additional time or resources to incorporate partner suggestions. Partners shared examples of when researchers failed to listen to or invite partner suggestions early, which resulted in the need for extensive revisions later that used up time and resources.\nNot All Partner Influence Resulted in an Observable Impact on the Study\nAbout 20% of the examples of influence did not have a reported, observable impact. These included examples where participants did not yet know the impact since the study was not complete, or partners did not know how their contributions had affected the study. Also, when influence was limited, it often resulted in no impact.\nBecause of Observable Impacts, Researchers and Partners Described Engagement as Worthwhile\nResearchers stated that, although engagement took time and effort, it yielded a valuable impact on the study. For example, one researcher said: “At first we viewed it as burdensome, but over time we really started to see the value in the way it was impacting the decisions we were making and how we were carrying out the study so that it would be more relevant to patients and providers on the front lines.” As a result, researchers said they were more likely to seek stakeholder input on study proposals and implementation problems in the future. Partners also valued the opportunity to have an impact on studies. For example, one partner said, “This study has opened my eyes personally to how important my input is. I did not know that until I got involved with this study, how important a patient’s voice is in studies.”\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings add a new level of understanding about both engagement and the dynamic nature of partnership in patient-centered research. Findings confirm earlier analyses of the benefits of patient and other stakeholder engagement in research and that active influence of partners most often improved studies’ feasibility and acceptability.2,6 Findings also offer new insights about how influence happens, show the diversity of influences that stakeholders have, and suggest additional impacts than what has been previously documented, including on engagement approaches.\nThe ways in which partners exerted influence on studies—by redirecting, co-producing, refining, or confirming—were dynamic, non-linear, and iterative, driving a cycle of influence across the stages of a study. Although these types of influence show conceptual similarity to the continuum of engagement identified in other frameworks, the underlying concepts differ.11 Because each study reported multiple types of influence, classifying an individual study to one type of influence—or a single place on the continuum of engagement—was not possible. Study teams could establish a “co-producing relationship” that could still have refining, redirecting, or confirming instances of influence. Similarly, study teams that initially engaged with partners as consultants could be transformed by early interactions, eventually amassing multiple examples of co-producing influence. In this way, engagement evolves throughout the lifecycle of study—weaving throughout the continuum of engagement in response to study needs. The discovery of iterative influence suggests that initial opportunities for stakeholder influence may generate future, though different, forms of influence, all of which increases the likelihood of desirable impacts on the study’s overall success.\nIt is worth noting that not all instances of influence resulted in a desirable, observable, or known impact on the study. The few reported undesirable impacts related to unanticipated delays or increased costs. Sometimes, researchers unintentionally constrained influence by not offering an opportunity or clearly articulating a role for stakeholders. In other cases, researchers could not implement stakeholders’ suggestions due to IRB constraints or other barriers. This finding adds weight to early conceptualizations of engagement that suggest that human and system factors can enable or disable partner contributions.11–13 Institutional system adjustments and training for researchers and partners in engagement may be warranted. For example, researchers and partners may need additional support balancing input and scientific rigor in team discussions.\nMany impacts identified by this study were proximal in nature. This focus is consistent with the fact that two-thirds of the studies in the sample were in progress and proximal impacts may be easiest to recognize and recall. It will be important, as a greater number of stakeholder-driven studies are completed and diffused, to also measure longer-term impacts, such as the relevance and usefulness of findings in healthcare decision making. Doing so requires having a comprehensive way of capturing proximal impacts as they are occurring. The taxonomy of types of influences and impacts from this study can be foundational to future research in this area.\nLimitations and Strengths\nWe used a purposeful sampling approach with PCORI-funded studies and conducted interviews in English, which may limit generalizability of the findings. For each study, we interviewed one partner and one to two researchers; other people involved in the study may have had different experiences. However, across studies, we were able to identify diverse perspectives, including patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders. Because interviewers were outside of the funder, participants had greater assurance of confidentiality to share less socially biased examples.\nAt times, interview participants had difficulty recalling specific examples of influence and impact. Because the analysis rested on recalled examples, it may not capture the full breadth of influences or impacts. To enhance recall, interviewers prompted participants to think back to specific events or decision-making points mentioned in study progress reports and asked them to share what they remembered. Even with the limitations, these systematic, in-depth qualitative findings lay a critical foundation for continued examination of engagement’s influence and impact.\nImplications\nFor funders and institutions, these findings continue to strengthen the evidence for investing in and supporting engagement in research, including further research on how to engage effectively to achieve and amplify these types of influences and impacts. The evidence for engagement now stands at a critical juncture—moving from describing the feasibility of engagement and the possible ways engagement can influence and impact studies to recommending how stakeholders should be engaged. To do so, direction for future research necessitates understanding what engagement approaches work best for whom at different stages of the research process, as well as the longer-term impacts of engagement on the uptake of research findings and ultimately health and health care.\nThese findings also have implications for measuring engagement processes and outcomes. There is a lack of useful, validated measures. Early measures may be overly simplistic by classifying levels of engagement to entire studies or perceiving engagement as linear. This study suggests that measuring engagement is more complex and will need to capture the multiple types of influence occurring within individual studies and how these different types iteratively build on each other.\nFinally, for clinical researchers wishing to realize influences and impacts in their own studies, these findings also offer insights. For engagement to be successful, previous research has highlighted the importance of clarifying roles and expectations for stakeholder partners and ensuring that partners understand the value of their efforts to the project.14 These findings offer additional insights to assess the progress and success of engagement, including whether engagement is yielding the desired influences and impacts on the study. For example, if partners are only confirming or refining existing plans or materials, studies may not be realizing the full potential of engagement. Researchers may need to build in opportunities for, pay attention to, and respond to stakeholders’ redirection; extend an invitation to co-execute study activities; or create opportunities for partners to lead and innovate on study tasks. Taking time to assess stakeholders’ interest in influencing the study and shaping opportunities accordingly engenders trust and authentic partnership.\nTaken as a whole, the findings suggest that the actions of funders and institutions to support engagement, efforts to improve measurement, and the formation of active partnerships between researchers and stakeholders are necessary to see the impacts we observed in this study in health research more broadly and ultimately move towards a culture of engagement.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge PCORI’s Patient Engagement Advisory Panel members from 2017 to 2019.

Since then they have been widely used in this and other contexts.\nAim: The aim of this paper is to summarize the main findings from research on structured abstracts and to discuss the limitations of some aspects of this research.\nMethod: A narrative literature review of all of the relevant papers known to the author was conducted.\nResults: Structured abstracts are typically longer than traditional ones, but they are also judged to be more informative and accessible. Authors and readers also judge them to be more useful than traditional abstracts. However, not all studies use “real-life” published examples from different authors in their work, and more work needs to be done in some cases.\nConclusions: The findings generally support the notion that structured abstracts can be profitably introduced into research journals. Some arguments for this, however, have more research support than others.\nINTRODUCTION\nReaders of this article will have noted that the abstract is set in a “structured” format. Such abstracts typically contain subheadings and subsections—such as “background,” “aim(s),” “method(s),” “results,” and “conclusions”—and provide rather more detail than do traditional ones. Furthermore, these features are clarified by the typographic layout. Structured abstracts are more common in articles describing experimental research but, as the example above indicates, they can also be used with reviews.\nStructured abstracts were introduced into medical journals in the mid 1980s [1], and, since then, their growth has been phenomenal [2]. Indeed, they are now commonplace in all serious medical research journals. Furthermore, their use has been recommended, and indeed is growing, in other scientific areas [3–8]. Structured abstracts can be found in American, European, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese journals [9]. In addition, some academic societies now require contributors to send potential conference submissions in this format. The British Psychological Society, for instance, has dispensed with the need for the three-to-four page summaries previously required from potential participants and now publishes the accepted structured abstracts in their Conference Proceedings [10].\nKEY FINDINGS\nThe case for using structured abstracts in scientific journals has been bolstered by research, most of which has taken place in a medical or a psychological context. Table 1 lists all of the research studies on the topic known to the author at the time of writing.\nTable 1 List of studies referred to in this paper\n\nOpen in a new tab\nThe results from these studies suggest that, compared with traditional ones, structured abstracts:\n\n\ncontain more information (studies 1–11), but not always so (study 12);\n\n\nare easier to read (studies 2, 3, 13);\n\n\nare easier to search (studies 3, 14), although some authors have questioned this (studies 15–17);\n\n\nare possibly easier to recall (study 18);\n\n\nfacilitate peer review for conference proceedings (studies 5, 6, 19); and\n\n\nare generally welcomed by readers and by authors (studies 1–3, 11, 19, 20).\n\n\nHowever, there have been some qualifications. Structured abstracts:\n\n\nusually take up more space (studies 1–4, 7, 11, 13, 21–24);\n\n\nsometimes have confusing typographic layouts (studies 25, 26); and\n\n\nmay be prone to the same sorts of omissions and distortions that occur in traditional abstracts (studies 8–10, 27–31).\n\n\nSOME OBSERVATIONS\nAlthough these findings seem clear-cut, some problems with the research in general need to be taken into account. Two main issues exist. First, but possibly not too important, is that many studies have used undergraduate students as participants, rather than postgraduates or fully fledged academics. Such undergraduates, of course, do not have the experience of full-time academics and post-graduates in reading journal abstracts, and thus the requirements of the studies may be rather different for them. Second, and much more important, is that not all of the studies have compared actual, previously published, traditional and structured abstracts, thus reducing the validity of the comparisons.\nFor a study to be properly valid in this context, one needs, in effect, to compare, from a particular journal, sets of published traditional abstracts with sets of (different/later) published structured abstracts. What has often happened in practice, however, is that either the structured versions of published traditional abstracts have been written independently by the researchers for the studies in question (studies 1, 2, 11), or the published traditional abstracts have been shortened and simplified for experimental purposes, and then structured versions of these simplified versions have been written by the researchers (studies 13, 14, 18). The main reason for this state of affairs stems from the fact that the researchers in question are often advocating the use of structured abstracts in a particular discipline where none (or very few) are available at the time of writing, and thus they have had to create their own. Such procedures do not destroy the validity of the findings, but they do limit their generality. To be properly valid, the abstracts need to be written by the authors of the articles and not by the researchers.\nApplying these considerations to the findings listed above, then:\n\n\nIt is not surprising that most studies find that structured abstracts contain more information than traditional ones. If researchers create structured abstracts from traditional ones, then it is likely that they will increase the amount of information that they provide when they are doing this. The best evidence to support the argument that structured abstracts contain more information than traditional ones comes from studies comparing published abstracts in both formats from the same journal or journals written by independent authors. Such studies that meet these requirements (studies 4, 5, 8–10, 12, 21) all support the view (with the exception of study 12) that structured abstracts are more informative than are traditional ones.\n\n\nIt is also perhaps not so surprising that structured abstracts appear easier to read than traditional ones, if the structured abstracts are revisions of the traditional ones (studies 1, 2, 11). Again, the best test of this readability hypothesis would come from studies comparing separately published abstracts in both formats. But no such studies on this issue have been reported.\n\n\nSimilarly, if the structured abstracts are revisions of simplified traditional ones, then it is perhaps not surprising that they are easier to search (study 14). Studies with the more complicated “real-life” abstracts presented in MEDLINE have not shown an advantage for search speed (studies 15, 17).\n\n\nVirtually no studies have been done on the recall of traditional and structured abstracts to find out whether or not structured abstracts are remembered any better than traditional ones. Six “miniature” studies outlined by Hartley and Sydes (reported in study 18) suggested that this was the case, when the structured abstracts were longer and were more readable than the traditional ones. However, this was not the case when the abstracts were equated for length and readability. Furthermore, these six studies were done with simplified versions of published abstracts, using students as participants. Research in other contexts suggests that structured text might be better recalled than text in traditional formats [11], although some people have argued that because less well-structured text requires more processing, it might subsequently be remembered better.\n\n\nSuggestions about the benefits of using structured abstracts for selecting conference papers are rarely evidence based. They simply suggest their usefulness in this respect. One exception is the study by McIntosh, Duc, and Sedin (study 6). These authors reported that referees were less frustrated reviewing the information content and deciding on the suitability of a conference submission when they judged resubmitted structured abstracts compared with traditional ones.\n\n\nMost studies of readers' reactions to structured versus traditional abstracts have in fact relied on the judgments of academics rather than students (studies 2, 3, 6), but few have been asked to judge independently published versions of both sets.\n\n\nIf structured abstracts do present more information, it is not surprising that they are usually longer than traditional ones. These 2 measures are correlated. The weighted average increase in length for the structured abstracts in the first 11 studies listed in Table 1 is 21%. However, 8 of these studies used simplified and/or especially written abstracts for the purpose of illustration. In the 3 studies that compared independently published abstracts and provided data on this measure, the structured abstracts were 40%, 30%, and 29% (weighted average 35%) longer than the traditional ones, respectively (studies 3, 21, 23).\n\n\nThere is, as yet, no hard information on whether or not structured abstracts contain less—or more—omissions, distortions, and errors than do traditional ones. Nonetheless, several authors have reported omissions in the published structured abstracts in the medical journals that they studied (studies 8–10, 27, 28). Hayes et al. (study 19) argued that structured abstracts might have fewer errors than traditional ones, but Pitkin and his colleagues (studies 29, 30) argued the reverse of this because of their extra length. But none of these authors have made direct comparisons. Hartley (study 31) found no differences in the degrees of distortion or errors between traditional and structured abstracts, but his structured abstracts were rewritten versions of traditional ones. So, to date, no one to the author's knowledge has compared the accuracy of separately published traditional and structured abstracts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe literature reviewed in the first part of this paper suggests that structured abstracts are an improvement over traditional ones. However, as argued in the second part, the evidence used to support these claims is sometimes not as good as we might wish. In particular, we have to judge the applicability of the findings from this research to the “real world.” The explosion in the use of structured abstracts, particularly in the medical context, suggests that these judgments have already been made.\nSome editors have complained that structured abstracts “take up too much space.” Indeed, the data reviewed in this paper from the more valid studies suggest that the extra space required by introducing structured abstracts may be quite considerable. But we have to remember here that we are only talking about the extra line-space required by the abstract and not the article as a whole. Indeed, setting a word limit (such as 200 words as in the Journal of the Medical Library Association) could control this amount. Whatever the case, introducing structured abstracts into a journal is unlikely to require changes in the overall pagination. There is often “free” space at the ends of articles, and typesetters are skilled at fitting text to appropriate page dimensions [12]. Such concerns, of course, do not arise with electronic journals and databases.\nSome authors—and some editors too—have also complained that the formats for structured abstracts are too rigid and that they present them with a straightjacket that is inappropriate for all journal articles. Undoubtedly, this may be true in some circumstances, but it is remarkable how in fact the subheadings used in this present article can cover a variety of research styles. The Research Results Dissemination Task Force of the Medical Library Association's Research Section, for example, provides suggested subheadings for experimental studies, qualitative studies, case reports, and reviews, all of which follow to some degree or other the basic format used here [13]. Furthermore, if readers care to examine current practice (or Table 4 in Hartley's 2000 Bulletin of the Medical Library Association paper [14]), they will find that even though the subheadings used here are typical, they are not rigidly adhered to. Editors normally allow authors leeway in the subheadings that they use.\nFinally, we might note that the research on structured abstracts is limited in two other ways. First, it is not clear in many studies whether or not the titles of the journal articles have been presented along with the abstracts, and clearly a title might help the reader to recall and possibly interpret the text under study [15]. Second, no one to the author's knowledge has studied complete articles with either traditional or structured abstracts. Here, where the abstract plays a small, but nonetheless important, role, it would be of interest to see if the format of the abstract affects the readers' judgments of the quality of an article (or even of a journal) as a whole.\nDespite these limitations, and the ones discussed earlier, the conclusions of this review are that the data discussed above do support the claim that structured abstracts are an improvement over traditional ones. Not only is more information presented, which is helpful for the reader, but also the format requires that the authors organize and present their findings in a systematic way. Furthermore, this consistency is made more obvious by the typographic layout. Advances in “text mining,” “research profiling,” and computer-based document retrieval systems can only profit from the use of these more informative abstracts.\nREFERENCES\n\nAd Hoc Working Group for Critical Appraisal of the Medical Literature.

Living well with UC\nFAQ\n\nTreatments for ulcerative colitis can prevent your immune system from overreacting and reduce inflammation in your colon. Treatments can also relieve symptoms and prevent complications of the disease.\n\nImage credit: mapodile/Getty Images\nUlcerative colitis (UC) causes inflammation and sores in the lining of your large intestine (colon). Over time, the disease can permanently damage your colon and lead to complications such as severe bleeding or a hole in your colon.\nYou’ll want to discuss all of your treatment options with a doctor. Once you’ve developed a treatment plan, it will be important to stick with the medication your doctor prescribes.\nIn preparation for this discussion, this article provides 12 helpful things you should know about treatment for UC.\n1. Your disease will determine which treatment you get\n\nUC treatment includes these drugs:\n\n5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs such as mesalamine\nsteroid drugs such as prednisone, prednisolone, and budesonide\nimmunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine\nbiologics such as infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira)\nJanus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as tofacitinib (Xeljanz) and upadacitinib (Rinvoq)\na monoclonal antibody like vedolizumab (Entyvio)\n\nYour doctor will help you choose a treatment based on three factors:\n\nthe stage of your UC (whether it’s active or in remission)\nhow much of your intestine is affected\nhow severe your condition is\n\nMild UC is treated differently than severe forms of the disease.\n2. Treatment has two goals\n\nUC isn’t curable. Its symptoms come and go. You’ll have periods of symptoms called flare-ups. They’ll be followed by symptom-free periods called remissions that can last for months or years.\nTreatment for UC aims to do two things:\n\nput the disease into remission\nhelp keep the disease in remission and prevent your symptoms from coming back\n\n3. Topical treatments may be enough for mild ulcerative colitis\n\nIf you have mild symptoms of UC and these symptoms also appear mild on a colonoscopy, your doctor might prescribe topical treatments. The type of topical treatment depends on the extent of your UC.\nIf your UC involves more than a third of your colon, your doctor will most likely recommend an oral pill (non-topical treatment). However, if the left side of your colon is affected, a doctor might prescribe an enema. If only the rectum is affected, a doctor might prescribe a suppository.\n4. UC drugs can cause side effects\n\nThe downside of treatment is that it can cause side effects. The side effects depend on the drug you take.\nCommon side effects from the 5-ASA drugs include:\n\nheadaches\nnausea\ncramps\ngas\nwatery diarrhea\nfever\nrash\n\nCommon side effects from steroid drugs include:\n\nincreased appetite\nweight gain\nacne\nfluid buildup\nsudden changes in mood\ntrouble sleeping\n\nBiologic drugs can make it harder for your body to defend itself against infections.\nYour doctor should monitor you closely while you’re taking these drugs. If your side effects are severe or unbearable, you may need to switch to another medication.\n5. You may need more than one treatment to keep you in remission\n\nEveryone responds differently to UC treatments.\nSome people will need more than one drug to manage their symptoms. For example, your doctor might prescribe both a biologic and an immunosuppressant medication.\nAdding another drug can increase the effectiveness of your treatment. But taking more than one medication can also increase the number of side effects you experience.\nYour doctor will balance managing your symptoms with possible risks of treatment when choosing a medication for you.\n6. Treatment can lead to remission\n\nStudies have found sulfasalazines, such as mesalamine, thiopurines, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies, to be effective at causing remission of UC.\nIf a drug leads to remission, the person will continue to take it. If they stop, the symptoms may return.\n7. UC treatment is long-term\n\nGoing into remission doesn’t mean your treatment ends. You’ll have to keep taking medication long-term to help keep your disease well-managed and prevent a relapse.\nYou may be able to take a lower dose of the drug once your disease is in remission.\n8. Good bacteria might help you feel better\n\nUC has been linked to harmful bacteria in the gut. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that help get rid of bad germs. Adding these supplements to your treatment could help keep you in remission.\nNot all probiotics are the same, however, and not all of them have evidence to show they can help with UC. Talk with your doctor before using this option.\n9. You don’t need to change your diet dramatically\n\nThere’s no evidence that following a strict diet can put your UC into remission or keep it there. In fact, cutting out certain foods could prevent you from getting the nutrients you need to stay healthy.\nYou may want to avoid certain foods — like dairy products — if they seem to worsen your symptoms. However, talk with your doctor or a dietitian before making any major changes to your diet.\n10. Surgery is a possibility\n\nBetween one-third and one-quarter of people with UC won’t see any relief with medication alone. Surgery to remove the colon may be considered as a last resort if you don’t respond to medications. Surgery is also necessary if a hole develops in the colon.\n11. For severe symptoms, you may need to visit a hospital\n\nIf you have severe diarrhea or bleeding and your disease isn’t responding to treatment, you may need to be admitted to a hospital for a short stay.\nThe doctors and other medical staff will give you fluids to prevent dehydration. You’ll also get medications to help relieve your symptoms.\n12. You can live well with UC\n\nOnce you find a drug that works well for you, you’ll have fewer flare-ups and more remissions.\nThanks to new and better medical treatments, most people with UC can keep their disease well managed and live active lives.\nFrequently asked questions about ulcerative colitis\n\nWhat is the fastest way to calm ulcerative colitis symptoms?\nTips you can try to calm symptoms of ulcerative colitis include limiting fiber, eating smaller meals, exercising, and reducing stress. You can also talk with your doctor about anti-inflammatory medications or a combination of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant medications to relieve symptoms and prevent flare-ups.\nWhat helps reduce inflammation when treating ulcerative colitis?\nAminosalicylates, also known as 5-ASAs, are usually the first treatment option for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. These medications help reduce inflammation and allow damaged tissue in the colon to heal.\nTalk with your doctor about what treatment options might work best for you.\nWhat is the most successful treatment for ulcerative colitis?\nAccording to the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, the most effective treatment plan for ulcerative colitis is multifaceted. This means it may involve medications, diet, and sometimes surgery.\nYou’ll want to talk with a doctor to develop a treatment plan that works best for you. And you may need to update and refine this plan to make sure it stays effective.\nWhat is the first-line treatment for a UC flare-up?\nThere is no such thing as a universal first-line treatment for UC flare-ups. Treatment depends on the person, their health, and the severity of their disease.\nSome patients can start with mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA), while others need biologics (such as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) right away.\nTalk with a doctor about what to do when these flare-ups occur. It’s important to have a plan in place before they happen.\nRead this article in Spanish.\nHow we reviewed this article:\nSources\nHistory\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

            "content": "How to Treat Mild Ulcerative Colitis\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is an ongoing condition that can cause inflammation and open sores, called ulcers, in the lining of your large intestines. It can start suddenly but usually begins slowly over time. UC can range from mild to severe. For most people, it comes and goes. Sometimes remission â time between flare-ups â can last for years.\n\nIf your condition is relatively mild, you may only have two to four bowel movements a day. The more serious your condition, the more likely you are to experience other common symptoms such as tiredness, fever, nausea, or weight loss.\n\nAbout half of people with ulcerative colitis have symptoms that are classified as mild. This type of UC can usually be treated without surgery or other extreme measures.\n\nMedications for Treating Mild UC\n\nUlcerative colitis is often treated with medications. The medication used will depend on how severe it is. These drugs work by reducing inflammation in the large intestine. For mild cases, your doctor may prescribe:\n\nThere are also over-the-counter drugs that can help manage symptoms. These might include:\n\nChanges to Make to Your Diet To Help With UC\n\nEating a healthy and well-balanced diet is important even for mild cases of ulcerative colitis. This could help prevent it from getting worse. While research hasnât found which specific foods cause ulcerative colitis symptoms, you may have certain âtrigger foodsâ that can make symptoms worse. Talk with your doctor about creating a meal plan. They may refer you to a dietitian who can help you find a pattern.\n\nA diet for ulcerative colitis generally involves:\n\nReduce Stress to Combat UC Flare-Ups\n\nWhile stress doesnât cause ulcerative colitis, it can trigger flare-ups and make your symptoms worse. Try the following for lowering your stress levels:\n\nMonitoring Ulcerative Colitis\n\nEven if your condition is mild, your doctor may want you to occasionally get colonoscopies. These help your care team monitor the inside of your rectum and colon to make sure your treatments are working and youâre healing. It will also help them watch for signs of colon cancer, which is an increased risk for people with IBD.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nCleveland Clinic: âUlcerative Colitis,â âWhat Not to Eat If You Have Crohnâs Disease.â\n\nCochrane Reviews: âProbiotics for Induction of Remission in Crohnâs Disease.â\n\nGastroenterology & Hepatology: âThe Role of Probiotics in IBD.â\n\nHarvard Gazette: âLiving Hydrogel Can Help Heal Intestinal Wounds.â\n\nJournal of the Royal Society of Medicine: âProbiotics and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.â\n\nMayo Clinic: âBiofeedback,â âUlcerative Colitis.â\n\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: âUlcerative Colitis.â\n\nOsteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center: âWhat People with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Need to Know About Osteoporosis.â\n\nMore on Ulcerative Colitis\n\nWhat Is Ulcerative Colitis?\n\n\n\n5 Tips to Control Your Ulcerative Colitis Flares\n\n\n\nUlcerative Colitis Surgery: What to Expect\n\n\n\nFEATURED\n\nTop doctors in ,\n\nFind more top doctors on\n\nRelated Links\n\nPolicies\n\nAbout\n\nFor Advertisers\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine lining. Anti-TTG antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to the presence of gluten.\nTable of Contents\n\nDefination of Anti TTG Antobodies:\nUnderstanding Celiac Disease:\nRole of Anti-TTG Antibodies:\nSignificance in Celiac Disease Diagnosis:\nSample and its Precautions:\nAnti TTG Test Types:\nNormal Values:\nResult Interpretation:\nConfirming Celiac Disease Diagnosis:\nFAQs:\nConclusion:\n\n\nDefination of Anti TTG Antobodies:\nThe Anti TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) antibodies test is a medical laboratory test used to diagnose and monitor certain autoimmune disorders, with a primary focus on celiac disease.\nUnderstanding Celiac Disease:\nCeliac disease, also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. Here’s a comprehensive overview to help you understand this condition:\n\nDefinition:\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an abnormal immune response to the consumption of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\n\n\nEpidemiology:\nCeliac disease can affect individuals of all ages, races, and genders.\nIt is estimated to affect around 1% of the global population, but many cases go undiagnosed.\n\n\nPathophysiology:\nIn individuals with celiac disease, the ingestion of gluten triggers an immune response.\nThis immune response leads to inflammation and damage to the lining of the small intestine (intestinal villi), which impairs nutrient absorption.\n\n\nSymptoms:\nCeliac disease can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including:\nGastrointestinal symptoms: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation.\nNon-gastrointestinal symptoms: Fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and neurological issues.\n\n\nSome individuals may be asymptomatic, which is referred to as “silent” celiac disease.\n\n\nDiagnosis:\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of blood tests (such as the Anti-TTG Antibody Test) and a small intestine biopsy.\nBlood tests help identify celiac-specific antibodies in the bloodstream.\nBiopsy confirms the characteristic damage to the small intestinal villi.\n\n\nTreatment:\nThe primary and only effective treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet.\nStrict avoidance of gluten-containing foods is necessary to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n\nComplications:\nUntreated celiac disease can lead to various complications, including malnutrition, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, and an increased risk of certain cancers.\n\n\nGluten Sensitivity vs. Celiac Disease:\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder with specific diagnostic criteria.\nGluten sensitivity, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms in response to gluten ingestion without the autoimmune response seen in celiac disease.\n\n\nManagement and Support:\nManaging celiac disease requires careful dietary planning and label reading to avoid hidden sources of gluten.\nSupport groups and resources are available to help individuals cope with the challenges of living gluten-free.\n\n\nResearch and Future Directions:\nOngoing research is focused on improving diagnostic methods, understanding the genetic basis of celiac disease, and exploring potential treatments beyond a gluten-free diet.\n\n\n\nAnti TTG Antibodies Test\nRole of Anti-TTG Antibodies:\nThe role of Anti-TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) antibodies is crucial in the context of celiac disease diagnosis and understanding. These antibodies play several important roles:\n\nDiagnostic Marker:\nAnti-TTG antibodies are a key diagnostic marker for celiac disease. Elevated levels of Anti-TTG antibodies in the blood are often indicative of an autoimmune response to gluten consumption.\nThey serve as a reliable indicator that an individual’s immune system is reacting to the presence of tissue transglutaminase in the small intestine.\n\n\nAutoimmune Response Indicator:\nThe presence of Anti-TTG antibodies in the bloodstream indicates that the immune system is targeting and reacting against tissue transglutaminase, an enzyme found in the lining of the small intestine.\nThis autoimmune response leads to the characteristic damage to the intestinal villi, which is a hallmark of celiac disease.\n\n\nScreening Tool:\nAnti-TTG antibody testing is often used as an initial screening tool for celiac disease, especially in individuals who exhibit symptoms like gastrointestinal discomfort, malabsorption issues, or unexplained weight loss.\nIt helps healthcare providers identify individuals who may need further diagnostic evaluation.\n\n\nMonitoring Disease Activity:\nAnti-TTG antibody levels can also be used to monitor disease activity and treatment effectiveness in individuals with celiac disease.\nA decrease in Anti-TTG antibody levels over time can indicate that the gluten-free diet is working and that the autoimmune response is subsiding.\n\n\nDifferentiating Celiac Disease from Other Conditions:\nWhile Anti-TTG antibodies are highly specific for celiac disease, their presence or absence can help differentiate celiac disease from other conditions, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\nIn non-celiac gluten sensitivity, Anti-TTG antibodies are typically not elevated.\n\n\nClinical Decision-Making:\nHealthcare providers use Anti-TTG antibody test results, in combination with other diagnostic information like small intestine biopsy findings, to make clinical decisions regarding celiac disease diagnosis and management.\n\n\nResearch and Understanding:\nAnti-TTG antibodies have been a subject of research in understanding the immunological mechanisms involved in celiac disease.\nStudying these antibodies helps researchers gain insights into the autoimmune responses that occur in celiac disease and may lead to potential therapeutic developments.\n\n\n\nSignificance in Celiac Disease Diagnosis:\nThe significance of Anti-TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) antibodies in celiac disease diagnosis is substantial. These antibodies play a central role in identifying and confirming the presence of celiac disease. Here’s why they are significant:\n\nHigh Sensitivity and Specificity:\nAnti-TTG antibodies have a high sensitivity and specificity for celiac disease. Sensitivity refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify individuals with the disease, while specificity refers to its ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease.\nIn the case of Anti-TTG antibody testing, it is highly sensitive, meaning it is effective at identifying individuals with celiac disease, and it is highly specific, meaning it is unlikely to produce false-positive results in individuals without celiac disease.\n\n\nEarly Detection:\nAnti-TTG antibody testing can detect celiac disease at an early stage, even before significant damage occurs to the small intestine.\nThis early detection is crucial because it allows for the initiation of a gluten-free diet before severe complications develop.\n\n\nNon-Invasive:\nUnlike small intestine biopsy, which is another important diagnostic tool for celiac disease, Anti-TTG antibody testing is non-invasive.\nIt involves a simple blood draw, making it less burdensome and more accessible for patients.\n\n\nScreening Tool:\nAnti-TTG antibody testing is often used as an initial screening tool for individuals suspected of having celiac disease.\nPositive results may prompt further diagnostic evaluation, including a small intestine biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis definitively.\n\n\nMonitoring Disease Activity:\nAnti-TTG antibody levels can be used to monitor disease activity and the effectiveness of treatment (typically a gluten-free diet) in individuals with celiac disease.\nA decrease in Anti-TTG antibody levels over time may indicate that the autoimmune response is subsiding due to dietary changes.\n\n\nDifferentiation from Other Conditions:\nCeliac disease can sometimes mimic the symptoms of other gastrointestinal disorders. Anti-TTG antibody testing helps differentiate celiac disease from these other conditions.\nFor example, non-celiac gluten sensitivity lacks the autoimmune response seen in celiac disease, and Anti-TTG antibody levels are typically not elevated in this condition.\n\n\nClinical Decision-Making:\nHealthcare providers use the results of Anti-TTG antibody testing, in conjunction with clinical symptoms and other diagnostic tests, to make informed decisions regarding celiac disease diagnosis and management.\n\n\n\nSample and its Precautions:\nSample Collection:\n\nSample for celiac disease diagnosis is typically a blood sample.\nThe blood is drawn from a vein, usually in the arm.\n\nPrecautions:\n\nFasting is not required; patients can eat before the test.\nInform the healthcare provider of any medications or supplements being taken, as they might affect the results.\nFor accurate results, ensure proper identification of the patient to prevent sample mix-up.\n\nAnti TTG Test Types:\n\nAnti-TTG IgA Test:\nThis test measures IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibodies against tissue transglutaminase.\nIgA antibodies are commonly used because they are found in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract, which is where celiac disease primarily affects.\nIt is the primary form of the Anti-TTG antibody test and is considered highly specific for celiac disease diagnosis.\nResults are typically reported in units such as U/mL (units per milliliter) or IU/mL (international units per milliliter).\n\n\nAnti-TTG IgG Test:\nIn some cases, individuals with celiac disease may have IgA deficiency, which can lead to false-negative results on the Anti-TTG IgA test.\nIn such cases, the Anti-TTG IgG test is used to detect IgG antibodies against tissue transglutaminase.\nThis test is often used as an alternative when IgA deficiency is suspected or confirmed.\nResults are also reported in units such as U/mL or IU/mL.\n\n\n\nNormal Values:\nThe normal reference values for the Anti-TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) antibody tests can vary between laboratories and assay methods. Typically, results for these tests are reported in units such as U/mL (units per milliliter) or IU/mL (international units per milliliter). Here are approximate normal reference ranges for both the Anti-TTG IgA and IgG antibody tests:\nAnti-TTG IgA Test:\n\nNormal Value: Typically less than 4 U/mL or IU/mL.\nA result below this threshold is often considered negative or normal, indicating a low likelihood of celiac disease.\n\nAnti-TTG IgG Test:\n\nNormal Value: Typically less than 6 U/mL or IU/mL.\nLike the IgA test, a result below this threshold is generally considered negative or normal.\n\nResult Interpretation:\nInterpreting the results of medical tests, including those for celiac disease like the Anti-TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) antibody tests, requires careful consideration of various factors. Here’s how you can interpret these test results:\nAnti-TTG IgA Test:\n\nNegative Result (Below the Reference Range):\nIf your Anti-TTG IgA test result falls below the established reference range (typically less than 4 U/mL or IU/mL), it is usually considered negative or normal.\nA negative result suggests a low likelihood of celiac disease. However, it does not completely rule out the possibility, especially in cases of IgA deficiency.\n\n\nPositive Result (Above the Reference Range):\nIf your Anti-TTG IgA test result is above the reference range, it is considered positive or elevated.\nAn elevated result suggests an autoimmune response to tissue transglutaminase and is indicative of a higher likelihood of celiac disease.\nA positive result should be followed up with additional diagnostic steps, such as a small intestine biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n\n\nAnti-TTG IgG Test:\n\nNegative Result (Below the Reference Range):\nSimilar to the IgA test, a negative result for the Anti-TTG IgG test (typically less than 6 U/mL or IU/mL) is considered normal and suggests a low likelihood of celiac disease.\n\n\nPositive Result (Above the Reference Range):\nAn elevated result on the Anti-TTG IgG test indicates the presence of IgG antibodies against tissue transglutaminase.\nThis result may be used when there is suspicion of IgA deficiency or when IgA-based tests are inconclusive.\nA positive Anti-TTG IgG result should also lead to further diagnostic evaluation, such as a small intestine biopsy, to confirm celiac disease.\n\n\n\nConfirming Celiac Disease Diagnosis:\nConfirming a diagnosis of celiac disease typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and, in many cases, a small intestine biopsy. Here are the steps involved in confirming celiac disease:\n\nClinical Evaluation:\nBegin with a thorough clinical evaluation by a healthcare provider, such as a gastroenterologist or primary care physician.\nThe healthcare provider will review your medical history and discuss your symptoms and family history, as celiac disease tends to run in families.\nBe sure to provide detailed information about any gastrointestinal symptoms, skin conditions, fatigue, or other health issues you have been experiencing.\n\n\nBlood Tests:\nBlood tests are often the initial step in diagnosing celiac disease. Two primary blood tests are commonly used:\nAnti-TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) IgA Test: This measures IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase. Elevated levels suggest an autoimmune response.\nTotal IgA Test: This test checks for IgA deficiency, which can affect the accuracy of the IgA-based tests. If you have IgA deficiency, other tests like the Anti-TTG IgG test may be used.\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Testing:\nGenetic testing may be performed to check for the presence of specific genetic markers associated with celiac disease, particularly the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes.\nHowever, having these genes does not necessarily mean you have celiac disease; it indicates a genetic predisposition.\n\n\nSmall Intestine Biopsy:\nA small intestine biopsy is often considered the gold standard for confirming celiac disease. It involves the removal of a tiny tissue sample from the lining of the small intestine during an endoscopy.\nThe biopsy is examined under a microscope to look for characteristic damage to the intestinal villi. This damage is a hallmark of celiac disease.\nA diagnosis of celiac disease is typically confirmed when the biopsy shows villous atrophy or other histopathological changes consistent with the disease.\n\n\nResponse to a Gluten-Free Diet:\nIn some cases, a positive response to a gluten-free diet may be considered supportive evidence of celiac disease. If your symptoms improve or resolve after adhering to a strict gluten-free diet, this suggests a diagnosis of celiac disease.\nHowever, a gluten-free diet should not be initiated before blood tests and biopsy, as this can affect test results.\n\n\nAdditional Testing:\nIn certain situations, additional tests may be conducted to assess complications or related conditions, such as osteoporosis, nutritional deficiencies, or skin disorders.\n\n\nConsultation with a Specialist:\nA gastroenterologist or a specialist in celiac disease is often involved in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease.\nThey can help coordinate and interpret the various tests and guide you through the diagnostic process.\n\n\n\nFAQs:\nWhat is the Anti-TTG antibodies test?\nThe Anti-TTG antibodies test is a blood test used to detect the presence and quantity of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase. It is primarily used in the diagnosis of celiac disease.\nWhy is the Anti-TTG antibodies test performed?\nThe test is performed to aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease by identifying an autoimmune response to gluten ingestion.\nWhat is the significance of Anti-TTG antibodies in celiac disease diagnosis?\nElevated Anti-TTG antibody levels in the blood indicate an autoimmune response to tissue transglutaminase, which is associated with the characteristic damage to the small intestine in celiac disease.\nHow is the test performed?\nA blood sample is typically collected from a vein in the arm. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nWhat are the normal reference values for the Anti-TTG antibodies test?\nNormal values can vary between laboratories but are often less than 4 U/mL or IU/mL for the Anti-TTG IgA test and less than 6 U/mL or IU/mL for the Anti-TTG IgG test.\nWhat does a positive Anti-TTG antibodies test result mean?\nA positive result suggests an elevated level of Anti-TTG antibodies in the blood, which is indicative of a higher likelihood of celiac disease.\nAre there other conditions that can cause positive Anti-TTG antibody results?\nWhile celiac disease is the primary condition associated with positive Anti-TTG antibody results, certain other autoimmune and gastrointestinal disorders can also cause elevated levels.\nWhat should I do if I have a positive Anti-TTG antibodies test result?\nA positive result should lead to further diagnostic evaluation, including genetic testing and a small intestine biopsy, to confirm the presence of celiac disease.\nCan Anti-TTG antibodies tests yield false-positive or false-negative results?\nWhile these tests are highly specific, factors such as IgA deficiency or recent gluten consumption can affect results. False negatives can occur, especially in individuals with IgA deficiency.\nIs it necessary to follow a gluten-containing diet before the test?\nTo increase the accuracy of the test, it is typically recommended to be on a gluten-containing diet for a period before testing. Consult your healthcare provider for specific guidelines.\nIs the Anti-TTG antibodies test the only diagnostic test for celiac disease?\nNo, celiac disease diagnosis usually involves a combination of clinical evaluation, antibody testing (including Anti-TTG), genetic testing, and, in many cases, a small intestine biopsy for confirmation.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the Anti-TTG (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase) antibodies test is a vital tool in the diagnosis of celiac disease, aiding in the identification of an autoimmune response to gluten ingestion. Elevated levels of these antibodies in the blood serve as a key indicator of the disease, prompting further diagnostic steps. However, a comprehensive diagnosis of celiac disease often involves a combination of clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and small intestine biopsy to confirm the presence of the condition and guide appropriate management, primarily a lifelong gluten-free diet.\n\nPossible References Used\n\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer:\nThe content on LabTestsGuide.com is for informational and educational purposes only.

            "content": "What Is a Tissue Transglutaminase IgA Test?\n\nA tissue transglutaminase IgA test or tTg-IgA test is an effective method used in the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is a blood test that checks for antibodies or immunoglobulins, which are proteins produced by the immune system. A high number of antibodies in blood indicate celiac disease. Â\n\nWhat Is Celiac Disease?\n\nCeliac disease is a long-term or chronic autoimmune disorder that affects your digestive system. An autoimmune disorder is diagnosed when your immune cells start attacking your body.Â\n\nCeliac disease is triggered when you eat foods that contain gluten âÂ a protein found in cereals like wheat, barley, and rye and foods like cakes, bread, and pasta. If you have celiac disease, your immune cells react to gluten and attack it. This, unfortunately, can damage your small intestine.Â\n\nCeliac disease is different from gluten sensitivity or wheat intolerance. It is a serious condition and can cause long-term digestive problems, which can prevent you from getting enough nutrients.\n\nWhat Causes Celiac Disease?\n\nPeople who eat too much gluten in their early childhood have a higher risk of developing celiac disease. Research also shows that people who get certain digestive tract infections early in life may develop celiac disease.\n\nThe condition can be hereditary, too. If a family member has it, you may have it, too.\n\nAdditionally, health conditions like type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease can increase the risk of celiac disease.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Celiac Disease?\n\nCeliac disease symptoms can vary from person to person. If you have celiac disease, you may have the following digestive problems:Â\n\nSymptoms are more common in children than in adults. Celiac disease also causes skin rashes and oral problems like tooth enamel defects or canker sores. Children with celiac disease may have growth problems because their bodies canât absorb enough nutrients. This can lead to delayed puberty, weight loss, slow development, short height, and mood changes.\n\nHow Is Celiac Disease Testing Done?\n\nCeliac disease testing involves the following:\n\nWhat Is a Tissue Transglutaminase IgA Test?\n\nA tissue transglutaminase IgA (or, tTg-IgA) test helps doctors diagnose celiac disease. If you have celiac disease, your immune system is triggered when you eat gluten. Your body starts treating gluten as a threat.Â\n\nYour immune system starts making antibodies or immunoglobulins to fight against the gluten. These antibodies may mistakenly attack an enzyme or protein in your intestines called tissue transglutaminase, which normally repairs and heals cells. Thatâs why these antibodies are also called anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies.\n\nWhen you have celiac disease, the levels ofÂ anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies increase in your body. Doctors check for these antibodies in your bloodÂ using the tissue transglutaminase IgA test.Â\n\nWhy Is a tTg-IgA Test Done?\n\nThe tissue transglutaminase IgA test is the most sensitive and effective method of celiac disease testing. It shows positive results in almost 98% of people with celiac disease who eat gluten.\n\nYour doctor will order a tTG-IgA test if you show symptoms of celiac disease. They may also order one if you have conditions like type 1 diabetes or thyroid disease, which increase the risk of celiac disease. You may also have to be tested if any of your family members have celiac disease.\n\nHow Is a tTg-IgA Test Done?\n\nBefore undergoing celiac disease testing, youâll have to eat a gluten-containing diet until the test for accurate results. Even if you have celiac disease, a lack of gluten can skew test results. Doctors recommend getting a tTg-IgA test before you stop eating gluten. No other preparation is required before the test. However, inform your doctor about other medicines you are taking.Â\n\nThe tissue transglutaminase IgA test is done by taking a blood sample. Your doctor will use a needle to draw blood from your vein. They will then test the blood for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. If your blood has high levels of celiac disease antibodies, youâll be diagnosed with the condition.Â\n\nRisks and Other Considerations\n\nThe tissue transglutaminase IgA test doesnât have any major risks. It is a simple blood test. However, you may feel a sting or pain when the doctor inserts the needle. You may have bleeding, bruising, or soreness around the site of the needle prick.\n\nThe tTg-IgA test may not be accurate in children and people with low anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody levels. This can lead to false-negative results. Your doctor may thus order other diagnostic tests to confirm whether you have celiac disease.Â\n\nTest results may also differ based on your age, gender, medical history, and the test used. Consult your doctor for more information regarding tests for celiac disease.\n\nSources:\n\nCeliac Disease Foundation: âTesting.â\n\nKidsHealth: âBlood Test: Tissue Transglutaminase IgA (tTg-IgA).â\n\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: âDefinition & Facts for Celiac Disease,â âDiagnosis of Celiac Disease,â âSymptoms & Causes of Celiac Disease.â\n\nUniversity of Rochester Medical Center: âAnti-Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody.â\n\nMore On Celiac Disease\n\nCeliac Disease: Symptoms, Risk Factors, and Treatment\n\n\n\nFast Facts About Gluten Free Foods\n\n\n\nTreatment Options for Celiac Disease\n\n\n\nFEATURED\n\nTop doctors in ,\n\nFind more top doctors on\n\nRelated Links\n\nPolicies\n\nAbout\n\nFor Advertisers\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

A healthcare professional is likely to start with a complete medical history, physical exam and tests to rule out other conditions, such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nAfter other conditions have been ruled out, a care professional is likely to use one of these sets of diagnostic criteria for IBS:\n\nRome criteria. These criteria include belly pain and discomfort averaging at least one day a week in the last three months. This also usually occurs with at least two of the following: pain and discomfort related to defecation, a change in the frequency of defecation, or a change in stool consistency.\nType of IBS. For the purpose of treatment, IBS can be divided into four types, based on symptoms: constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predominant, mixed or unclassified.\n\nA healthcare professional also will likely explore whether you have other symptoms that might suggest another, more serious condition. These include:\n\nOnset of symptoms after age 50.\nWeight loss.\nRectal bleeding.\nFever.\nNausea or repeated vomiting.\nBelly pain, especially if it's not related to passing stool, or occurs at night.\nDiarrhea that is ongoing or awakens you from sleep.\nAnemia related to low iron.\n\nIf you have these symptoms, or if an initial treatment for IBS doesn't work, you'll likely need more tests.\nAdditional tests\nA healthcare professional may recommend several tests to help with diagnosis.\nDiagnostic procedures can include:\n\nColonoscopy. In colonoscopy, a camera attached to a small, flexible tube is used to examine the entire length of the colon.\nCT scan. This test produces images of the abdomen and pelvis that might rule out other causes of symptoms, especially if belly pain is present.\nUpper endoscopy. A long, flexible tube is inserted down the throat and into the esophagus, which is the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. A camera on the end of the tube provides a view of the upper digestive tract. During an endoscopy, a tissue sample called a biopsy may be collected. A sample of fluid may be collected to look for overgrowth of bacteria. This test may be recommended if celiac disease is suspected.\n\nLaboratory tests can include:\n\nLactose intolerance tests. Lactase is an enzyme needed to digest the sugar found in dairy products. If a person doesn't produce lactase, they may have problems like those caused by IBS, including belly pain, gas and diarrhea. A healthcare professional may order a breath test or ask you to remove milk and milk products from your diet for several weeks.\nBreath test for bacterial overgrowth. A breath test also can determine if there is bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth is more common among people who have had bowel surgery or who have diabetes or some other disease that slows down digestion.\nStool tests. Stool might be examined for bacteria, parasites or the presence of bile acid. Bile acid is a digestive liquid produced in the liver. Stool studies also can check to see if the intestine has trouble taking in nutrients. This is a condition known as malabsorption.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic\nOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your irritable bowel syndrome-related health concerns Start Here\nMore Information\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome care at Mayo Clinic\nColonoscopy\nCT scan\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy\n\nShow more related information\nTreatment\nTreatment of IBS focuses on relieving symptoms so that you can live as symptom-free as possible.\nMild symptoms often can be controlled by managing stress and by making changes in diet and lifestyle. Try to:\n\nStay away from foods that trigger symptoms.\nEat high-fiber foods.\nDrink plenty of fluids.\nExercise regularly.\nGet enough sleep.\n\nA healthcare professional might suggest eliminating these foods:\n\nHigh-gas foods. If bloating or gas are an issue, don't consume carbonated and alcoholic beverages or certain foods that may lead to increased gas.\nGluten. Research shows that some people with IBS report improvement in diarrhea symptoms if they stop eating gluten even if they don't have celiac disease. Gluten is found in foods containing wheat, barley and rye.\nFODMAPs. Some people are sensitive to certain carbohydrates such as fructose, fructans, lactose and others, known as FODMAPs — fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. FODMAPs are found in certain grains, vegetables, fruits and dairy products.\n\nA dietitian can help with these diet changes.\nIf problems are moderate or severe, a healthcare professional might suggest counseling — especially if depression or stress tends to make symptoms worse.\nBased on symptoms, medicines may be recommended, including:\n\nFiber supplements. Taking a supplement such as psyllium husk (Metamucil) with fluids may help control constipation.\nLaxatives. If fiber doesn't help constipation, nonprescription laxatives, such as magnesium hydroxide oral (Milk of Magnesia) or polyethylene glycol (Miralax), may be recommended.\nAntidiarrheal medicines. Nonprescription medicines, such as loperamide (Imodium A-D), can help control diarrhea. A care professional also might prescribe a bile acid binder, such as cholestyramine (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid) or colesevelam (Welchol). Bile acid binders can cause bloating.\nAnticholinergic medicines. Medicines such as dicyclomine (Bentyl) can help relieve painful bowel spasms. They are sometimes prescribed for people who have bouts of diarrhea. These medicines are generally safe but can cause constipation, dry mouth and blurred vision.\nTricyclic antidepressants. This type of medicine can help relieve depression, but it also blocks the activity of neurons that control the intestines. This may help reduce pain. If you have diarrhea and belly pain without depression, a healthcare professional may suggest a lower than typical dose of imipramine (Tofranil), desipramine (Norpramin) or nortriptyline (Pamelor). Side effects — which might be reduced if you take the medicine at bedtime — can include drowsiness, blurred vision, dizziness and dry mouth.\nSSRI antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) or paroxetine (Paxil), may help if you are depressed and have pain and constipation.\nPain medicines. Pregabalin (Lyrica) or gabapentin (Neurontin) might ease severe pain or bloating.\n\nMedicines specifically for IBS\nMedicines approved for certain people with IBS include:\n\nAlosetron (Lotronex). Alosetron is designed to relax the colon and slow the movement of waste through the lower bowel. It can be prescribed only by providers enrolled in a special program. Alosetron is intended only for severe cases of diarrhea-predominant IBS in women who haven't responded to other treatments. It is not approved for use by men. Alosetron has been linked to rare but important side effects, so it only should be considered when other treatments aren't successful.\nEluxadoline (Viberzi). Eluxadoline can ease diarrhea by reducing muscle contractions and fluid secretion in the intestine. It also helps increase muscle tone in the rectum. Side effects can include nausea, belly pain and mild constipation. Eluxadoline also has been associated with pancreatitis, which can be serious and more common in certain people.\nRifaximin (Xifaxan). This antibiotic can decrease bacterial overgrowth and diarrhea.\nLubiprostone (Amitiza). Lubiprostone can increase fluid secretion in the small intestine to help with the passage of stool. It's approved for women who have IBS with constipation, and is generally prescribed only for women with severe symptoms that haven't responded to other treatments.\nLinaclotide (Linzess). Linaclotide also can increase fluid secretion in your small intestine to help you pass stool. Linaclotide can cause diarrhea, but taking the medicine 30 to 60 minutes before eating might help.\n\nPotential future treatments\nResearchers are investigating new treatments for IBS, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Considered investigational at this time, FMT restores healthy intestinal bacteria by placing another person's processed stool into the colon of a person affected by IBS. Clinical trials to study fecal transplants are currently underway.\nMore Information\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome care at Mayo Clinic\nAcupuncture\nHypnosis\n\nRequest an appointment\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

Your body typically needs time to respond to these changes. Try to:\n\nExperiment with fiber. Fiber helps reduce constipation but also can worsen gas and cramping. Try slowly increasing the amount of fiber in your diet over a period of weeks with foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables and beans. A fiber supplement might cause less gas and bloating than fiber-rich foods.\nStay away from problem foods. Get rid of foods that trigger your symptoms.\nEat at regular times. Don't skip meals, and try to eat at about the same time each day to help regulate bowel function. If you have diarrhea, you may find that eating small, frequent meals makes you feel better. But if you're constipated, eating larger amounts of high-fiber foods may help move food through your intestines.\nExercise regularly. Exercise helps relieve depression and stress, stimulates contractions of your intestines, and can help you feel better about yourself. Ask a healthcare professional about an exercise program.\n\nAlternative medicine\nThe role of alternative therapies in relieving IBS symptoms is unclear. Ask a healthcare professional before starting any of these treatments. Alternative therapies include:\n\nHypnosis. A trained professional teaches you how to enter a relaxed state and then guides you in relaxing your abdominal muscles. Hypnosis may reduce belly pain and bloating. Several studies support the long-term effectiveness of hypnosis for IBS.\nPeppermint. Studies show that, in people who have IBS with diarrhea, a specially coated pill that slowly releases peppermint oil in the small intestine (enteric-coated peppermint oil) eases bloating, urgency, abdominal pain and pain while passing stool.\nProbiotics. Probiotics are \"good\" bacteria that typically live in your intestines and are found in certain foods, such as yogurt, and in dietary supplements. Recent studies suggest that certain probiotics may relieve IBS symptoms, such as belly pain, bloating and diarrhea.\nStress reduction. Yoga or meditation can help relieve stress. You can take classes or practice at home using books, videos or apps that can be downloaded to a smartphone.\n\nPreparing for your appointment\nYou may be referred to a provider who specializes in the digestive system, called a gastroenterologist.\nWhat you can do\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions, such as restricting your diet before your appointment.\nWrite down your symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason why you scheduled the appointment.\nWrite down any triggers to your symptoms, such as specific foods.\nMake a list of all your medicines, vitamins and supplements.\nWrite down your key medical information, including other conditions.\nWrite down key personal information, including any recent changes or stressors in your life.\nWrite down questions to ask your provider.\nAsk a relative or friend to go with you, to help you remember what the healthcare professional says.\n\nQuestions to ask your doctor\n\nWhat's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\nWhat tests do I need? Is there any special preparation for them?\nWhat treatment approach do you recommend? Are there any side effects associated with these treatments?\nShould I change my diet?\nAre there other lifestyle changes that you recommend?\nDo you recommend that I talk with a counselor?\nI have other health problems. How can I best manage these conditions together?\nIf I have IBS, how long will it take for me to see improvement from the therapy you have prescribed?\n\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment anytime you don't understand something.\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYou'll likely be asked a few questions. Being ready to answer them may leave time to go over points you want to spend more time on. You may be asked:\n\nWhat are your symptoms, and when did they begin?\nHow severe are your symptoms? Are they continuous or occasional?\nDoes anything seem to trigger your symptoms, such as foods, stress or — in women — your menstrual period?\nHave you lost weight without trying?\nHave you had fever, vomiting or blood in your stools?\nHave you recently experienced significant stress, emotional difficulty or loss?\nWhat is your typical daily diet?\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a food allergy or with lactose intolerance?\nDo you have any family history of bowel disorders or colon cancer?\nHow much would you say your symptoms are affecting your quality of life, including your personal relationships and your ability to function at school or work?\n\nWhat you can do in the meantime\nWhile you wait for your appointment:\n\nAsk family members if any relatives have been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer.\nStart noting how often your symptoms occur and any factors that seem to trigger them.\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nIrritable bowel syndrome care at Mayo Clinic\nRequest an appointment\nSymptoms & causesDoctors & departments\nOct. 11, 2024\nPrint\nShow references\n\nHadjivasilis A, et al.

However, they may refer individuals to rule out other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nIBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause changes in bowel movements, such as diarrhea, constipation, or both. Someone with IBS needs to discuss the risks of having a colonoscopy and the alternatives that may be available.\n\nThis article looks at whether people with IBS should have a colonoscopy and if it can worsen IBS. It also explores how to prepare for a colonoscopy and any possible risks.\n\nShould people with irritable bowel syndrome have a colonoscopy?\n\nNo, generally, doctors do not refer people with IBS for a colonoscopy unless someone presents with symptoms that doctors consider concerning signs.\n\nPossible concerning signs may include:\n\nThe American College of Gastroenterology does not usually recommend routine colonoscopy in those under 45 with IBS symptoms and no warning signs or features.\n\nPeople with no alarming signs may receive a diagnosis through blood and stool tests. Specialized tests can accurately determine whether a person has IBS with diarrhea or IBD by looking for specific molecules in the blood.\n\nHowever, doctors would refer people with symptoms consistent with IBS and warning signs for a colonoscopy. This will help rule out other causes, such as IBD and colorectal cancer.\n\nIndications a doctor may refer someone for a colonoscopy may include:\n\nSometimes, doctors may perform a biopsy during colonoscopy in people with diarrhea to confirm the other possible diagnoses. Biopsy involves taking a small sample of the tissue.\n\nA person can discuss possible options with their doctor, who can determine the best method to diagnose them.\n\nPreparing for colonoscopy\n\nThe preparation for a colonoscopy is generally the same for someone with IBS as it is for a person without the condition also undergoing the procedure. Still, some doctors might advise people with IBS-C or constipation to undergo more extensive preparations.\n\nAn adequate level of bowel cleansing is important for a successful colonoscopy. Usually, a doctor will provide specific instructions on how to prepare for the procedure.\n\nBowel preparation\n\nThis involves taking a laxative medication to clean out the bowel. This may be in pill, liquid, or powder form. Some people will drink the liquid over a scheduled time, usually the night before and the morning of the procedure.\n\nDoctors may also recommend enemas. The prep will cause diarrhea, so a person might want to be close to a toilet.\n\nDietary changes\n\nPeople need to avoid foods that are high in fiber several days before the procedure, such as:\n\nThey must also drink clear liquids for at least 1 day before the procedure. This may include only drinking:\n\nRead more about how to prepare for a colonoscopy.\n\nCan colonoscopy make IBS worse?\n\nThere is limited research on whether a colonoscopy worsens IBS, and an individual’s experiences may also vary.\n\nAnecdotally, people report that the following may cause IBS to worsen:\n\nBowel preparation can sometimes cause excessive bloating and gas, which might worsen the pain and discomfort relating to IBS.\n\nWhile very little research focuses on the effects of the procedure on IBS, researchers have examined the risks of it worsening IBD.\n\nAdditional 2019 research suggests that the colonoscopy procedure, or bowel preparation, may exacerbate IBD symptoms.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nBesides those above, the risks relating to a colonoscopy are likely to be similar whether someone has IBS or not.\n\nPotential risks of a colonoscopy include:\n\nIn 3 out of every 10,000 procedures, perforation may occur, and in 15 out of every 10,000 procedures, bleeding occurs. Most cases occur in people who are older or who have undergone polyps removal.\n\nSummary\n\nExperts do not recommend routine colonoscopy in people under 45, with IBS symptoms and no alarming signs or features. Individuals may have blood and stool tests to help diagnose their condition.\n\nHowever, doctors refer people for a colonoscopy if they have symptoms consistent with IBS and warning signs. This will help rule out other causes, such as IBD and cancer.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine whether a colonoscopy makes IBS worse.\n\nPeople need to follow the doctor’s instructions to prepare for a colonoscopy.\n\n\n\nHow we reviewed this article:\n\nShare this article\n\nLatest news\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nPeople can use blood test kits at home to test for some types of IBS.

It is characterized by deficits in cognitive, psychiatric, and motor function and can range in severity from minimal (or covert) hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) to overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), coma, and death. Patients with MHE demonstrate neuropsychological alterations including disrupted sleep–wake cycle, personality changes, impairment of attention, cognitive and memory dysfunction, and changes in motor coordination. These can progress through to higher grades of OHE, including lethargy, stupor, coma, and death; these are more pronounced in patients with acute liver failure. HE is a frequent and debilitating manifestation of decompensated liver disease affecting patients and their careers alike. The scope of this review is to outline the current understanding and ongoing research into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this complex neuropsychiatric condition.\nAmmonia\nAmmonia has long been regarded as the key metabolic factor underpinning the development of HE since the original description of the “meat intoxication syndrome” in portacaval‐shunted dogs at the end of the 19th century. In the presence of liver failure, decreased utilization of ammonia as a substrate in the hepatic urea cycle (the major mammalian ammonia detoxification pathway) and portosystemic shunting lead to the accumulation of ammonia in the systemic circulation, which readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Cerebral ammonia detoxification occurs via glutamine synthetase, exclusively expressed in cerebral astrocytes, in the formation of glutamine, which is an important precursor of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters: glutamate and gamma‐hydroxybutyric acid (GABA), respectively. Astrocytic glutamine accumulation exerts an osmotic effect resulting in swelling and cytotoxic edema, which leads to increased brain water on magnetic resonance imaging and worsening HE (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nThe role of ammonia in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Decreased hepatic urea‐cycle metabolism in the context of liver cirrhosis and/or portosystemic shunting leads to the accumulation of ammonia (NH3), a product of protein catabolism, in the systemic circulation. Ammonia readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and is metabolized in a cerebral detoxification pathway by GS, with the formation of glutamine occurring exclusively in cerebral astrocytes. Accumulation of glutamine exerts an osmotic effect, with the influx of water leading to astrocytic swelling. Glutamine is shuttled via transporters (SNAT 5/SNAT 1) to presynaptic neurones and converted to GABA or glutamate before release into the inhibitory or excitatory synaptic cleft, respectively, and subsequently scavenged by astrocytic reuptake transporters (EAAT1/2).\nHyperammonemia and subsequent glutamine accumulation induce changes in cerebral neurotransmission. Acute hyperammonemia leads to excessive glutamate‐induced N‐Methyl‐D‐aspartic acid (NMDA)‐receptor activation, which can cause neuronal death. Blockade of the NMDA receptor has been shown to be protective in this context.1 Also noted is an increase in “GABAergic tone,” with an observed clinical response to flumazenil, a GABAA receptor antagonist. Rabbits exposed to benzodiazepines and rabbits with acute liver failure demonstrate similar visual‐evoked potentials.2\nInflammation\nHowever, circulating hyperammonemia does not explain all of the pathophysiological processes underpinning HE. Arterial ammonia concentrations correlate poorly with clinical presentations of HE in cirrhosis, and increasingly recognized is the importance of the synergistic role between hyperammonemia and inflammation/infection in the development of HE. Progressive encephalopathy was noted to occur in patients with higher systemic inflammatory response scores in acute liver failure3; and infection was shown to exacerbate neurocognitive dysfunction following an ammonia load in patients with cirrhosis, which resolved following antibiotic therapy.4 Bile‐duct–ligated cirrhotic rats progressed to precoma stages of encephalopathy following intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide, a gram‐negative cell wall peptide.5 A proinflammatory cytokine plasma milieu verus arterial ammonia or the severity of liver disease has been shown to independently correlate with the presence and severity of HE.6 Potential pathophysiological mechanisms explaining the susceptibility to developing HE during episodes of infection include cerebral hyperemia with increased brain ammonia delivery, astroglial oxidative stress with microglial activation and neuronal dysfunction, and innate immune system dysfunction arising from systemic inflammation and circulating endotoxemia.7 The maintenance of a high index of suspicion of infection underlying clinical presentations of HE and expedient treatment remains pivotal in its management.\nThe Intestinal Microbiome and Hepatic Encephalopathy\nChanges in the gut microbiota of patients with liver cirrhosis are considered central to bacterial translocation, endotoxemia, and systemic inflammation that can result in the development of HE. Liu et al. demonstrated that cirrhotic patients with MHE had significant fecal overgrowth of Escheria Coli and Staphylococcus Spp. and went on to show that treatment with synbiotics reduced blood ammonia and endotoxemia and improved MHE scores.8 More recently, the advent of culture‐independent techniques in quantitating and speciating bacterial colonic flora has sparked a burgeoning interest in the role of the intestinal microbiota in HE.\nOvergrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut microbiome relative to autochthonous (commensal) bacteria correlates with worsening liver disease severity, with studies demonstrating that the change in composition of the microbiota is associated with higher model for end‐stage liver disease scores.9 Furthermore, significant changes in enteric microbiota have been described between patients with MHE and OHE, with the latter group demonstrating a higher dysbiosis ratio10 (Fig. 2).\nFigure 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nChanges in microbiota with worsening liver disease severity and cognitive performance. Comparing patients with differing severity of liver cirrhosis and comparing cirrhotic patients with and without the presence of OHE reveals an observed difference in the intestinal bacterial composition, with a relative paucity of autochthonous floral bacteria that have pathological species overrepresented, creating a dysbiosis. This changes gut ammonia metabolism and contributes to colonic inflammation, portal circulation endotoxemia, increased inflammatory burden in the presence of portal hypertensive enteropathy, and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiome represents an attractive therapeutic target in the management of cirrhotic patients with HE.\nLactulose is a nonabsorbable disaccharide that has a pleiotropic role in the treatment of HE and has long formed the cornerstone of empirical HE treatment. It has been shown to change the colonic pH favoring retention of ammonium salts in the bowel lumen and exerts a prebiotic effect favoring the colonization of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium; it also reduces intestinal transit time and may therein reduce ammonia absorption. Similarly, probiotics tilt the intestinal microbiota toward nonurease‐producing organisms, decrease luminal production of ammonia, and have been shown to be effective in the prevention of HE in cirrhosis.11 Rifaximin‐α is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that maintains remission from OHE with a reduction in hospitalizations due to HE over a 6‐month period.12 Interestingly, it was not shown to alter the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria; instead, it may be exerting its therapeutic effect by reducing circulating endotoxemia and manipulating bacterial function and virulence.13\nConclusion\nHE remains one of the major challenges and morbidities facing patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Even in its subclinical presentation, it exerts a profound influence on patient quality of life and functional capability and confers a damning prognosis. Recurrent encephalopathy is in itself an extended criterion for consideration of liver transplantation. Increasing understanding of the interplay between the liver, the intestinal microbiome, and the innate immune system allows for the development of exciting new technologies and treatments to include in the clinician's armory for tackling this neurophysiological manifestation of decompensated liver disease (Fig. 3). A low threshold of suspicion and early specialist review, complex neuropsychological evaluation, and identification and treatment of precipitants are required in the approach to a patient with liver cirrhosis and altered mentation.\nFigure 3.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nOverlapping pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning the development of hepatic encephalopathy and revealing targets for therapeutic intervention. No single pathophysiological pathway explains in full the development of HE; and it is increasingly recognized that hyperammonemia, systemic inflammation, and intestinal dysbiosis act in a synergistic cascade that terminates in the development of HE. Equally, no single treatment is completely effective at ensuring resolution and preventing the recurrence of HE. Recognizing the multifaceted pathophysiological process driving the development of HE has allowed for innovative therapeutic targeting.

Focal loss of neurons may also occur in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum. Pathophysiology of HE in cirrhosis is multifactorial, involving brain accumulation of ammonia and manganese, systemic and central inflammation, nutritional/metabolic factors and activation of the GABAergic neurotransmitter system. Neuroimaging and spectroscopic techniques reveal early deactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex in parallel with neuropsychological impairment. T1-weighted MR signal hyperintensities in basal ganglia resulting from manganese lead to a novel entity, ‘Parkinsonism in cirrhosis’. Elucidation of the pathophysiological mechanisms has resulted in novel therapeutic approaches to HE aimed at reduction of brain ammonia, reduction of systemic and central inflammation, and reduction of GABAergic tone via the discovery of antagonists of the neurosteroid-modulatory site on the GABA receptor complex.\nIntroduction\nHepatic encephalopathy (HE) encompasses a wide range of cognitive, psychomotor and psychiatric disturbances resulting from acute or chronic severe liver diseases. The appearance of HE in cirrhosis heralds a poor prognosis with negative impact on health-related quality of life, liver transplant priority and patient survival. Consequently, effective therapies for HE are urgently required. The design of such therapies requires an evidence-based understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the pathophysiology of HE.\nHE is subdivided into three major types:\nType A\nHE resulting from acute liver failure.\nType B\nHE resulting from portosystemic bypass/shunting.\nType C\nHE resulting from cirrhosis.\nCovert HE is a newly-defined sub-type of Type C HE that occurs in up to 80% of patients with cirrhosis and is diagnosed by well-established psychometric tests. The term ‘covert HE’ is the mildest form of HE, and it replaces the previous term ‘minimal HE’ (MHE), to which the addition of grade 1 ‘Overt HE’ (OHE) [1] is made, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.\nFour axes define the underlying disease type (A, B, C), the grade of HE (minimal, grade 1, 2, 3, 4 or covert, overt), the time course (episodic, recurrent, persistent) and whether spontaneous or precipitated\n\nOpen in a new tab\nCellular Neuropathology of Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) In Cirrhosis\nAn effective understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms relating to HE in cirrhosis requires an understanding of the nature and extent of cellular changes occurring in the brain as a consequence of the failing liver. In type C HE, pathological changes to cells of both the astroglial and neuronal lineages have been described.\nGlial Cells\nThe cardinal neuropathological feature of HE in cirrhosis is a characteristic morphological alteration known as Alzheimer Type 2 astrocytosis, where astroglial cells (astrocytes) manifest nuclear pallor, swelling and margination of the chromatin pattern [2]. A second type of glial cell, the microglial cell, is also commonly implicated in HE in cirrhosis, and activation of microglia is indicative of a pro-inflammatory mechanism [3].\nNeurons\nNeuronal cell death, although less common, also occurs in HE [4]. Acquired Non-Wilsonian hepatocerebral degeneration (AHCD) occurs in cirrhosis often following multiple episodes of coma. Spongiform degeneration occurs in deep cortical layers, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Post-shunt myelopathy, like AHCD, occurs in patients with cirrhosis following multiple episodes of coma and, occasionally, following the TIPS procedure. Symptoms of spastic paresis or paralysis of the lower limbs are apparent, resulting from demyelination of direct and crossed corticospinal tracts.\nUnsuspected Wernicke-type haemorrhagic lesions in thalamic nuclei resulting from thiamine deficiency occur in up to 30% of patients with end-stage cirrhosis of alcoholic aetiology. The higher incidence of Wernicke-type lesions in patients with cirrhosis probably relates to the fact that the liver is a major site for thiamine synthesis and storage in humans. Mild to severe cerebellar degeneration characterized by loss of Purkinje cells occurs in patients with cirrhosis [5]. There are no clear correlations between the incidence and extent of cerebellar degeneration, Wernicke-type thalamic lesions and Alzheimer Type 2 astrocytosis, suggesting distinct mechanisms.\nParkinsonism in cirrhosis is an entity characterized by extrapyramidal symptoms, with a reported prevalence as high as 21% [6]. The disorder has been attributed to dopaminergic neuronal deficits resulting from manganese deposition in the basal ganglia of the brain.\nPathophysiology\nMajor avenues of research into mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of HE in cirrhosis include:\n\n\nthe effects of toxins on brain structural and functional integrity\n\n\nprimary brain energy failure\n\n\npro-inflammatory processes and\n\n\ncentral neurotransmission imbalance in favour of excess neuroinhibition mediated by GABA.\n\n\nAmmonia\nRemoval of excess ammonia relies primarily on its conversion to urea via the urea cycle located in periportal hepatocytes together with the formation of glutamine via the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) localized in perivenous hepatocytes, as shown in Fig. 1. Patients with cirrhosis commonly develop portal-systemic shunting combined with reduced hepatocyte metabolic capacity resulting in hyperammonemia [2].\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nSchematic representation of the concept of inter-organ trafficking of ammonia under normal physiological conditions compared to a patient with cirrhosis and HE\nHowever, impairment of hepatic ammonia removal in cirrhosis sets in motion an adaptive pathway involving activation of the gene coding for GS in skeletal muscle [7]. In this way, muscle provides an alternative pathway for ammonia removal as glutamine, as shown in Fig. 1.\nArterial blood and brain ammonia levels are increased several-fold in patients with cirrhosis, and dynamic 13NH3- positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrate significant increases of cerebral metabolic rate for ammonia in these patients [8].\nConcentrations of ammonia equivalent to those reported in brain in acute and/or chronic liver failure are known to exert direct effects on both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission [9].\nAmmonia is also a potent inhibitor of the rate-limiting tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase resulting in impaired glucose oxidation, lactate production and impending brain energy failure [10].\nRemoval of excess ammonia by brain depends exclusively on the synthesis of glutamine via GS. 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies of patients with cirrhosis reveal increased concentrations of brain glutamine that are correlated with the grade of HE [11].\nManganese\nIn a study of 51 patients with cirrhosis, 11 patients (21.6%) exhibited characteristic bilateral MRI signal hyperintensities in basal ganglia. The degree of signal hyperintensity was not correlated with the aetiology of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh scores or fasting blood ammonia, and no patients had OHE at the time of imaging. Extrapyramidal symptoms included a symmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome, tremor, stooped posture and gait impairment with rapid progression over months [6]. Blood manganese concentrations were elevated up to sevenfold in all of nine patients in whom measurements were made and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) manganese concentrations were increased in all of three cases from whom CSF was available.\nIn a previous study, basal ganglia tissue from patients with cirrhosis who died in hepatic coma contained several-fold increased manganese concentrations as well as alterations of dopaminergic (DA) marker proteins and metabolite patterns characteristic of Parkinson’s Disease [12]. Liver transplantation results in normalization of MRI signal hyperintensities and circulating manganese levels resulting in improved CNS symptoms [6]. Treatment of two patients with cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism with L-DOPA resulted in substantial improvements of motor function [6].\nPro-inflammatory Mechanisms\nSystemic inflammation resulting from infection and/or hepatocellular damage is common in cirrhosis, and the acquisition of a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) is a major predictor of HE in these patients. SIRS results from the release into the circulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and the interleukins IL-1β and IL-6. Circulating levels of TNFα are invariably increased in patients with cirrhosis, and the increase correlates well with the grade of OHE [13].\nMicroglial activation indicative of inflammation of the brain has been identified in autopsied brain tissue samples from patients with cirrhosis who died in hepatic coma [14]. Activated microglia are known to express transcripts for the mitochondrial translocator protein (TLP), and PET studies with the selective TLP ligand 11C-PK11195 show activation of microglia in patients with cirrhosis and MHE. Particularly intense signals are observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain structure associated with the control of attention in these patients [15].\nLiver-to-brain pro-inflammatory signalling occurs in HE and, at the cellular level, human cerebrovascular endothelial cells exposed to TNFα manifest increased capacity for the transport of ammonia [16]. Astroglial cells exposed to combinations of ammonia and recombinant pro-inflammatory cytokines show increased expression of genes implicated in HE.\nCerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\nThere is no convincing evidence to support the hypothesis that HE is primarily caused by brain energy failure. However, PET studies using the glucose transport ligand 18Fluorodeoxyglucose in patients with cirrhosis and covert HE reveal significant decreases in uptake in the anterior cingulate cortex [8]. Decreased brain glucose uptake in these patients was correlated with impaired performance on psychometric testing.\nAmmonia inhibits the TCA cycle, an essential metabolic pathway involved in the maintenance of brain energy requirements [10]. Slowing of the cycle results in increased CSF lactate concentrations that correlate well with severity of HE in patients with cirrhosis [17].\nCerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with cirrhosis is altered in a region-selective manner where flow to cerebral cortical regions is decreased while flow to basal ganglia, cerebellar and thalamic structures is significantly increased. Since this pattern of changes in CBF parallels the regional changes of brain glucose utilization, CBF auto-regulation (defined as the capacity of CBF to match brain activity independent of changes of systemic arterial pressure) appears to be preserved in patients with cirrhosis [18].\nInhibitory Neurotransmission\nActivation of GABAergic transmission (‘increased GABAergic tone’) was proposed based on visual evoked response patterns in experimental animals with HE that were identical to patterns observed in normal animals treated with activators of the GABA receptor complex (GRC) [19]. These findings led to intense interest in activation of the GRC as a major factor implicated in the pathogenesis of HE, an interest that continues to this day. Initially, studies were focussed on the measurement of biochemical components of the GABA system. In all cases, these parameters were found to be present in normal amounts in material from patients who died in grade 4 HE [20].\nThe GRC has a number of allosteric modulatory sites that are targets for benzodiazepines and neurosteroids [21]. Occupation of these sites by their endogenous agonist ligands results in a magnification of the GABA signal and its neuroinhibitory response. Allopregnanolone (ALLO) is a neurosteroid modulator of the GRC and, hence, an activator of GABAergic neurotransmission. Significant increases of ALLO have been reported in brain tissue from patients with decompensated cirrhosis who died in stage 4 HE (coma) [22] (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nIncreased brain concentrations of allopregnanolone in patients with cirrhosis who died in grade 4 HE, age-matched controls, patients with cirrhosis without encephalopathy (LD) and a case of uraemic coma (UC)\nFurthermore, brain extracts from HE patients result in increased binding of the GABA agonist ligand 3H-muscimol to brain membrane preparations, thus satisfying the requirement that brain concentrations of ALLO observed in HE patients had the potential to result in ‘increased GABAergic tone’.\nTranslation of Pathophysiological Findings to the Clinic\nThe ultimate validation of a proposed mechanism for the pathogenesis of HE in cirrhosis relies on the results of clinical trials in which removal of the pathophysiological insult results in reduced severity of encephalopathy.\nAgents Aimed at Lowering Ammonia Production\nAgents shown to be effective in randomized clinical trials for the lowering of gut ammonia production leading to improved mental state include the non-absorbable disaccharide lactulose, the broad-spectrum antibiotic rifaximin and probiotics, all of which inhibit the production of ammonia in the gastrointestinal tract [23].\nAgents Aimed at Increasing Ammonia Removal\nl-ornithine l-aspartate (LOLA) has potent ammonia-lowering properties through mechanisms involving urea synthesis (l-ornithine is a urea cycle substrate) as well as removal of ammonia via GS by residual hepatocytes and skeletal muscle. Results of meta-analyses provide an evidence base for the efficacy of LOLA for the lowering of venous ammonia and improvement of mental status in all grades of HE in cirrhosis [24]. LOLA also has impressive hepatoprotective properties [25].\nBenzoate and phenyl acetate have been successfully used for treatment of congenital hyperammonemias in children. Benzoate is also effective for the treatment of HE in cirrhosis [26], and studies in which phenyl acetate is combined with glycerol or L-ornithine are beginning to show promise.\nGABA-Receptor Modulators\nAgents aimed at decreasing ‘GABAergic tone’ in the brain of HE patients are still the subject of intense investigation. Antagonists of the benzodiazepine and neurosteroid modulatory sites on the GABA-A receptor are available and have been evaluated as possible treatments for HE in cirrhosis. Flumezenil, a potent antagonist of the benzodiazepine site, has proven efficacy in patients with OHE [27], although the effect is relatively short acting due to the short half-life of the agent. More recently, GR 3027, an antagonist of the neurosteroid site, was shown to improve spatial learning, circadian rhythm disturbances and motor coordination in an experimental animal model of chronic liver disease [28]. Clinical trials are currently ongoing.\nSummary\nThe pathophysiology of HE in cirrhosis involves both astroglial and neuronal modifications caused by accumulation of ammonia and manganese, inflammation, nutritional/metabolic factors and neurosteroid-induced activation of the GABAergic system. Neuroimaging techniques reveal early deactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex and increased T1-weighted MR signal hyperintensities in basal ganglia resulting from manganese deposition, leading to Parkinsonism. These insights have resulted in novel therapeutic approaches to HE aimed at reduction of ammonia as well as antagonists of the neurosteroid-modulatory site on the GABA receptor complex.\nFunding\nFunding for studies in the author’s research unit was provided by The Canadian Institutes for Health Research.

Use for informational purposes only.\nPancreatitis pain is unique.\nThe pain often starts abruptly in acute pancreatitis and becomes severe and persistent for several days.\nAcute pancreatitis pain is unlikely to come and go in episodes; however, patients may experience exacerbations and partial remissions.\nOn the other hand, patients with chronic pancreatitis may experience recurrent abdominal pain that comes and goes in attacks for several years.\nKeep reading this article to understand the characteristic of pancreatitis pain in both acute and chronic pancreatitis.\n1. Does acute pancreatitis pain come and go?\nIn most cases of acute pancreatitis, the pain is often persistent and severe. Acute pancreatitis pain may be partially relieved by sitting up or leaning forward. But it doesn’t go away completely.\nMoreover, The character and severity of pain may differ according to the cause of pancreatitis.\nFor example, people with acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse often have less abrupt and poorly recognized pain.\nOn the other hand, patients with acute pancreatitis due to gallstones often have a more rapid onset and sharper pain. In addition, patients with gallstone pancreatitis may experience exacerbation and partial relief (the pain doesn’t go away completely).\nFeatures of acute pancreatitis pain (reference):\n\nOnset: The onset of pain is often abrupt. The pain evolves rapidly.\nCourse: The pain often persists for several days and doesn’t disappear. You may experience.\nSite: the pain is in the upper central abdomen (epigastric area) and the left upper abdomen area. Some patients may also feel pain in the right upper quadrant. Rarely the pain may be confined to the left upper quadrant.\nRadiation of the pain: In 50% of the patients, the pain often radiates to the center of the mid-back.\nWhat relieves the pain: the pain often is partially relieved by sitting up or bending forward.\nAssociated symptoms: nausea and vomiting are present in 90% of the patients.\n\nConclusion:\nAcute pancreatitis pain is often persistent. It is not usual for pancreatitis pain to come and go away completely.\n2. Causes of pain that comes and goes & mimic pancreatitis.\nSeveral painful conditions may cause upper abdominal pain that mimics pancreatitis pain.\n\nBiliary colics.\nAn attack of acute gastritis.\nIrritable bowel syndrome.\nFunctional dyspepsia.\nChronic pancreatitis (discussed in the next section).\n\nBiliary colic (gallbladder attacks) has bouts of severe pain (similar to pancreatitis pain severity) that come and goes. However, the pain is often in the right upper abdomen (the gallbladder area).\nBut sometimes, biliary colic pain may become central (epigastric), resembling pancreatitis. So, the most important cause of pain that comes and goes resembling pancreatitis pain, is gallbladder pain.\nThe table below illustrates the characteristics of a gallbladder attack:\nYou can learn more in this article: Mimics of gallbladder pain.\n\nSurprisingly, about 5-10% of patients with acute pancreatitis may not have pain!\n3. Does chronic pancreatitis pain come and go?\nThe pattern of pain with chronic pancreatitis is different among patients. Some patients may experience chronic relentless pain that doesn’t go away. In others, the pancreatitis pain may come and go in attacks.\nThe severity of pain varies according to the cause, and it may change over time. However, pain severity doesn’t correlate with the severity of damage to the pancreas in chronic pancreatitis.\nThree recognized patterns of pain can occur with acute pancreatitis:\n\nPersistent pain (for months or years, doesn’t go away).\nExacerbations and partial remissions.\nAttacks of pain then pain-free periods (AKA, the pain comes and goes).\n\nUntreated Pancreatitis: 6 Possible Scenarios.\n5 links between Constipation & Pancreatitis (Acute & Chronic).\nSymptoms suggesting chronic pancreatitis:\n1 . Abdominal pain\n\nThe pain can be any one of the three patterns mentioned above.\nIt is often less severe than acute pancreatitis pain.\nIt may come and go in the upper central abdomen (epigastric area) and radiate to the back.\nThe pain may exacerbate when you lay on your back or after meals.\n\n2. Steatorrhea (fatty diarrhea).\n\nOngoing pancreatic damage often results in malabsorption of foods, especially fats, due to lipase enzyme deficiency.\nPatients experience persistent or recurrent greasy (oily) offensive diarrhea or loose stool attacks.\nThe stool color is often yellowish or greasy and may float in the toilet.\nSteatorrhea often develops LATE after 5-10 years of chronic pancreatitis (reference).\nSo, its absence doesn’t exclude pancreatitis when you have pain that comes and goes resembling pancreatitis.\n\nMORE: 9 Common Stool Changes with Pancreatitis (With color illustrations).\n3. Asymptomatic or mild pain that comes and goes.\n\nA small percentage of patients with chronic pancreatitis may be completely asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms.\nSome patients also may have minimal intermittent symptoms such as abdominal pain that comes and goes.\nIf your pain is not responding to simple anti-acid and antispasmodic medications, discuss with your doctor the possibility of chronic pancreatitis (especially if you have risk factors).\nRisk factors for chronic pancreatitis include:\n    – Alcoholism (responsible for 50% of the cases of chronic pancreatitis in the USA).\n    – Smoking.\n    – Increased blood lipids (triglycerides).\n    – Diabetes mellitus.\n    –  Recurrent acute pancreatitis.\n\n4. Other symptoms:\n\nNausea.\nRecurrent vomiting.\nShortness of breath.\nWeight loss.\nExcessive thirst.\nGeneralized weakness and fatigue.\n\n5. Causes of chronic abdominal pain that comes and goes (mimics chronic pancreatitis).\n\nChronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease (PUD).\nChronic inflammation or ulceration of the stomach and duodenum causes attacks of upper central (epigastric) pain that comes and goes for long periods. The pain often is exaggerated by meals and is relieved by antacids and proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a very common functional disease that often presents with recurrent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, and the pain often decreases by defecation.\nFunctional dyspepsia (FD).\nFunctional dyspepsia is another functional disease that causes discomfort or pain in the epigastric area after meals. The condition is chronic, and the pain or discomfort often comes and goes over long periods.\nGERD (Acid reflux).\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux is a chronic condition when significant amounts of stomach acid reach the esophagus.\n    The condition often presents burning chest pain and regurgitation of food or acidic material into the throat. However, some patients with GERD may complain of upper abdominal pain that comes and goes (especially if they have a hiatal hernia).\n    Learn More.\nFood intolerance.\n    Food intolerance occurs when your body cannot digest certain types of food or food constituents. Common examples include lactose intolerance and FODMAP intolerance.\n    Food intolerance patients may have Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and excess gases.\n    Learn More.\nCeliac disease.\nGallstone disease.\nOther pancreatic diseases such as cancer pancreas.\n\n6. When to see a doctor.\nYour doctor should evaluate any significant abdominal pain that comes and goes without apparent cause. However, The pain is more likely to be something serious when it is associated with:\n\nChronic diarrhea (especially if it is offensive or greasy).\nWeight loss.\nFever.\nSevere nausea or vomiting.\nJaundice (yellow skin and eye whites).\nPersistent loss of appetite (anorexia).\nSignificant abdominal pain that doesn’t respond to antispasmodic and other stomach medicines.\nSevere or persistent abdominal distension (excess gases).\n\nBlood in the stool or black tarry stools.\n\n\nEvidence-based\n\nWritten by a doctor.\n\nMD, Associate Lecturer of Gastroenterology and hepatology.

This is a result of extensive fibrosis and inflammation within the gland that eventually leads to both exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. The pathogenesis of disease remains controversial and several theories have been proposed to explain its pathophysiology1. The Necrosis-Fibrosis theory is the most widely accepted which essentially states that chronic fibrotic changes ensue after a series of recurrent acute insults to the periductal areas1. While no theory has been conclusively proven, it is likely that the pathogenesis of disease is a complex interworking of multiple etiologies and cofactors.\nCP poses many challenges to clinicians. One of the biggest dilemmas is establishing a clear diagnosis. The arsenal of tests and imaging modalities available to providers is vast and this speaks to the often cumbersome task of making the diagnosis as there is usually not one image or test that reliably establishes CP. Diagnosis can be particularly elusive in patients with early chronic pancreatitis (also known as minimal change chronic pancreatitis3) given that these patients classically present with clinical symptoms suggestive of chronic pancreatitis but lack definitive radiographic abnormalities. Other objective parameters that assist in diagnosis, such as indirect pancreatic function tests (PFTs), can often be normal for years after the onset of symptoms. Conversely, there have been subsets of patients described that have evidence of pancreatic fibrosis with no clinical symptomatology indicative of CP. This suggests that the degree of fibrosis is not directly correlated with the degree of exocrine & endocrine dysfunction8. Many studies have been undertaken to improve diagnostics in chronic pancreatitis, but this has been significantly limited by the lack of a gold standard. ERCP had once been touted as a potential gold standard for chronic pancreatitis but it only evaluates ductal anatomy and studies have shown it can have a propensity of attributing ductal changes to chronic pancreatitis when in-fact they are secondary to environmental, obesity, or age-related changes20, 21. Currently, histology is the gold standard but obtaining it safely and routinely is not currently available. However, even when autopsy tissue is reviewed for CP diagnosis there are profound age-related findings that may be confused for changes related to chronic pancreatitis22. A true diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis may not be made simply by clinical history, imaging or function testing alone, but rather by evidence gathered by a combination of these diagnostic tools. Since management largely focuses on both delaying progression and treating symptoms of the disease, rather than cure, providers need to be certain prior to rendering this diagnosis.\nDisease Presentation and Risk Factors\nCommon presentations of disease include chronic abdominal pain, steatorrhea, diabetes, and weight loss of unexplained etiology. Initial evaluation in patients presenting with signs and symptoms concerning for CP should include a thorough history and screening for key risk factors for CP, especially alcohol and tobacco use given these risk factors will increase the pre-test probability of disease. In the United States the most common etiology of chronic pancreatitis remains alcohol6. Yadav et al found that the prevalence of heavy drinking for men (defined as 2–5 drinks/day) and women (defined as 1–5 drinks a day) was 38.4% and 11.0% for CP, respectively. This was compared to 10.0% and 3.6% for controls. This led to an odds ratio of 3.10 for heavy drinking in CP. Importantly this study also concluded that cigarette smoking was an independent, dose-dependent risk factor for CP as well as recurrent acute pancreatitis7. Smoking ≥ 1 pack per day equated to 3.3 times greater odds to develop chronic pancreatitis7.\nTwo major classification systems have been established to help assess risk factors in the development of CP: TIGAR-O and MANNHEIM (table 1) and are helpful in guiding providers as to when to initiate testing for CP. Current testing modalities are generally in two categories: Imaging (CT, MRI, EUS, ERCP) and pancreatic function tests (further divided into direct and indirect tests). Each of these tests have unique roles in establishing the diagnosis and it is important that clinicians follow an outlined approach in the workup of CP in order to avoid unnecessary testing and misdiagnosis. This section aims at going over the initial evaluation as well as describing how imaging and PFTs can be used in the process of evaluating a patient with suspected CP.\nTable 1.\nMajor Classification Systems of Etiologies for Chronic Pancreatitis\n| Classification for CP Etiology |\n| :-- |\n| Traditional |\n| \n\n|\n| Alcohol, idiopathic, hereditary, obstructive, hyperlipidemia |\n| \n\n|\n| TIGAR-O |\n| \n\n|\n| Toxic-metabolic: alcohol, tobacco smoking, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal failure, medications, toxins |\n| Idiopathic: early onset, late onset, tropical |\n| Genetic mutations: PRSS1, CFTR, SPINK1, others |\n| Autoimmune: isolated, syndromic |\n| Recurrent and severe AP-associated CP: postnecrotic (severe AP), vascular disease/ischemic, postirradiation |\n| Obstructive: pancreas divisum, sphincter of Oddi disorders, duct obstruction (eg, tumor), posttraumatic pancreatic duct scars |\n| \n\n|\n| MANNHEIM |\n| \n\n|\n| M indicates multiple risk factors including: |\n| Alcohol consumption: excessive (>80 g/d), increased (20–80 g/d), moderate (<20 g/d) |\n| Nicotine consumption |\n| Nutritional factors: high caloric proportion of fat and protein, hyperlipidemia |\n| Hereditary factors: hereditary, familial, idiopathic (early onset, late onset), tropical |\n| Efferent duct factors: pancreas divisum, annular pancreas and other congenital abnormalities of the pancreas, pancreatic duct obstruction (eg, tumors), posttraumatic pancreatic duct scars, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction |\n| Immunological factors: autoimmune pancreatitis |\n| Miscellaneous and rare metabolic disorders: hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, chronic renal failure, drugs, toxins |\nOpen in a new tab\nImaging for Chronic Pancreatitis\nComputed Tomography\nComputed tomography (CT) is considered the best initial imaging test in the workup for CP. Advantages of CT scans are that they are widely accessible, show a detailed view of pancreatic morphology changes seen in CP, and are especially useful in detecting changes seen in advanced disease. It can also quickly assess extra-pancreatic pathology that may explain various presentations mimicking chronic pancreatitis. Another advantage of CT is its ability to detect various complications of acute and chronic pancreatitis such as pseudo cysts, biliary or duodenal obstruction, venous thrombosis, pseudoaneursyms and pancreatico-pleural fistulas4. There are three findings classically seen on CT in CP, including, a dilated pancreatic duct (68%), pancreatic atrophy (54%), and pancreatic classifications (50%)9 (see figure 1). Note that normal pancreatic morphology may also be observed on CT imaging in CP, making the diagnosis particularly difficult in certain population of patients. Additionally, while pancreatic atrophy is visualized in a large proportion of patients with CP, this is not a specific finding and can also be seen with normal aging. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1, pancreatic enlargement may also be visualized in chronic pancreatitis. While changes of pancreatic parenchyma in late CP are visualized, CT fails to visualize classic changes seen within the pancreatic ducts, thus making it unreliable to diagnose early CP.\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nComputed Tomography findings in CP [4]\nMRCP\nWhile CT has seen profound improvements over the last 3 decades (such as multidector and multi-phase imaging with contrast), there are significant limitations in diagnosing CP, particularly in evaluation of pancreatic ductal anatomy as well as assisting in diagnosis of early CP. MRCP & secretin enhanced MRCP (sMRCP) are both sensitive and specific for characteristic changes seen in CP. Specific advantages of MRCP evaluation in CP are better visualization of both the pancreatic parenchyma and ducts. Parenchymal changes that are visualized via MRI include pancreatic atrophy, depressed T1 signal, irregular contour of head or body, heterogeneous parenchyma, and delayed gadolinium enhancement of the pancreas after administration6. Ductal changes include intraductal filling defects often indicative of calculi, main pancreatic duct dilation, side branch dilation, irregular duct contour, and decreased compliance after administration of secretin6. While there are no standardized criteria for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis with the use of MRCP, pancreatic image grading systems have been proposed that describe changes seen in normal to severe CP (see table 2). In general, the Cambridge Classification can be modified to classify MRCP findings. With the increasing use of sMRCP, a formal grading system is needed that evaluates both parenchymal and ductal changes as this may better guide clinicians in early diagnosis of CP.\nTable 2.\nM-ANNHEIM pancreatic imaging Criteria for Chronic Pancreatitis\n| Cambridge Grading | CT, US, MRI/MRCP | EUS |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Normal | Quality Study depicting whole gland without abnormal features (0 points) |  |\n| Equivocal | One abnormal feature (1 point) | Four or fewer abnormal Features (no differentiation between equivocal and mild) (1 point) Five or more abnormal features (no differentiation between moderate and marked) (3 points) |\n| Mild changes | Two or more abnormal features, but normal main pancreatic duct |\n| Moderate changes | Two or more abnormal features, including minor main pancreatic duct abnormalities (either enlargement between 2 and 4 mm or increased echogenicity of the duct wall) (3 points) |\n| Marked changes | As above with one ore more of the required features of marked changes (4 points) |  |\nOpen in a new tab\n• Abnormal Features: Main pancreatic duct enlargement (2–4 mm), slight gland enlargement (up to 2× normal), heterogeneous parenchyma, small cavities (10 mm), irregular ducts, focal acute pancreatitis, increased echogenicity of the main pancreatic duct wall, irregular head/body contour\n• Marked Changes: Large cavities (>10 mm), gross gland enlargement (>2× normal), intraductal filling defects or calculi, duct obstruction, structure or gross irregularity, contiguous organ invasion\nSecretin enhanced MRCP allows for a non-invasive approach to evaluate for pancreatic exocrine function. Secretin is a peptide that prompts cells within the pancreatic duct to release bicarbonate rich fluid into the small bowel. Similar to direct pancreatic function tests (discussed later), this method uses IV secretin and subsequently observes the T2 intensity changes seen within the pancreatic duct. This is used as a surrogate marker for pancreatic exocrine function [11]. sMRCP allows for better visualization of pancreatic ducts as well as side branches compared to conventional MRCP. Prior to sMRCP, ERCP had been considered the gold standard for diagnosis because of its ability to detect subtle changes within the pancreatic ducts and the side branches. This is due to the retrograde administration of contrast that leads to over-distension of the pancreatic ducts11. While this over-distension does not occur with the physiologic filling of the pancreatic ducts, adequate visualization of the main pancreatic duct, side branches and accessory pancreatic ducts (if present) does occur with sMRCP11.\nOn average, healthy individuals will distend the pancreatic duct to approximately 2/3 of its diameter in response to secretin administration11. This decreases as severity of disease worsens, which is likely due to the amount of fibrosis within the gland11. Another measure of pancreatic function that can be elicited from sMRCP are pancreatic duct flow rates. One study evaluated 76 patients with CP and measured changes in small bowel water volume. This was quantified, plotted against time and flow rate was subsequently derived. Flow rates were compared from patients with pancreatic disease of varying degrees to people with normal pancreas tissue. Normal patients were found to have flow rates of 7.4 ± 2.9 ml/min, compared to 5.3 ± 2.4 ml/min in severe CP, 3.8 ± 3.1 ml/min in pancreatic atrophy, and 5.3 ± 2.4 ml/min in subjects with stone obstruction (all statistically significant)13. These results suggest that flow rates through the pancreatic duct diminish with increasing pancreatic fibrosis and atrophy. In addition, this study showed that sMRCP could potentially be used to evaluate a spectrum of pancreatic pathology, not just CP.\nEndoscopic Ultrasound\nEndoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) is another tool that has increasingly been used in the workup of chronic pancreatitis. As discussed earlier, the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is typically not in doubt in those individuals with severe disease, as they will have classic symptoms, risk factors and usually pathologic imaging features on CT or MRCP. In early CP, the diagnosis is rarely straightforward and may be confused with other disease entities. It is in this subset of patients where EUS has the most potential to assist in diagnosis, as it is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes in advanced CP.\nLike MRCP, EUS evaluates for both parenchymal and ductal changes in the pancreas 6,14 for diagnoses of CP. A total of nine EUS criteria (4 parenchymal and 5 ductal) have been proposed by the International Working Group in the diagnosis of CP16 (see table 3). The presence of greater than five findings provides a definitive diagnosis of CP where as two or less effectively rules out this disease. Patients with 2–5 criteria have an indeterminate diagnosis and should be thoroughly worked up further with pancreatic function testing. The nine criteria have been linked to distinct histological changes noted from specimens collected after EUS evaluation17. Changes seen with EUS can be nonspecific and seen in healthy patients, as shown by Rajan et al 15. In this study, EUS findings were reviewed in 120 patients with no known pancreatic pathology and it was shown that as regular aging ensues, people are more likely to develop at least 1 parenchymal and 1 ductal EUS abnormality. This was observed 23% of the time in patients <40, 25% in ages 40–60 and 39% in patients >60 years old.\nTable 3.\nEUS Criteria for Chronic Pancreatitis and Histological Correlates 6,17\n| EUS Criteria | Histologic Correlate |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| \n\n|\n| :-- |\n| Parenchymal freatures |  |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Hyperechoic foci | Focal Fibrosis |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Hyperechoic strands | Bridging Fibrosis |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Lobular contour | Interlobular Fibrosis |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Cysts | Cyst/pseudocyst |\n|  | \n\n|\n| Ductal Features |  |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Main duct dilation (mm) | >3 head, > 2 body, >1 tail |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Duct irregularity | Focal dilation/narrowing |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Hyperechoic margins | Periductal Fibrosis |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Visible side branches | Side branch dilation |\n|  | \n\n|\n|  Stones | Calcified stones |\n|  | \n\n|\nOpen in a new tab\nWhile these criteria are helpful in the workup of CP, there has been much debate as to the interpretation of findings, as again, these may be the result of normal aging, smoking, or obesity and unrelated to CP. Furthermore, EUS is operator dependent, making it potentially vulnerable to inter-endosonographer variability. This is a major disadvantage of EUS and remains as one of the biggest hurdles for its use in the diagnosis of CP. One study compared EUS interpretations across 11 experienced endosonographers. There findings showed moderately good agreement for a final diagnosis of CP as well as for two of the features (duct dilation and lobularity), however there was poor agreement for the other seven features of EUS18. Given the lack of standardization across EUS interpretation in the context of CP, the Rosemont criteria were developed. These criteria represented the consensus opinion of 32 endosongraphers with the goal to create a more standard approach in the interpretation of EUS findings in CP14. At the conclusion of the meeting, major and minor criteria were developed. Major criteria were divided in A and B. Major A criteria included hyperechoic foci with shadowing and main pancreatic duct calculi. Major B criteria included lobularity with honeycombing. Minor criteria included: dilated ducts (greater than 3.5 mm), presence of pancreatic cysts, irregular pancreatic duct, dilated side branches (greater than 1 mm), hyperechoic duct wall, strands, non-shadowing hyperechoic foci and lobularity with noncontiguous lobules14. Direct comparison of Rosemont to standard criteria shows little benefit at diagnosing CP when compared to pancreas function testing.\nIn summary, EUS has potential to be useful for diagnosis of early CP since it is highly sensitive for detecting pancreatic abnormalities; however, there are important limitations including only fair interobserver agreement and low specificity of some findings (2–5). The Rosemont criteria are the most widely used diagnostic criteria for CP, but have suboptimal accuracy, particularly for early CP. Considering the large number of potential explanations for EUS abnormalities of the pancreas this test should not be used in isolation to establish a clinical diagnosis of CP. Additional research is needed to optimize this imaging modality, including assessment of novel imaging techniques such as EUS elastography and assessment of pancreatic duct compliance following secretin stimulation.\nEndoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a modality seldom used for diagnosis of CP at the present time. It allows for a detailed pancreatogram, which can show some changes related to chronic fibrosis and atrophy. However following the advent of CT, MRCP, and EUS, its use is typically limited to therapeutic interventions rather than purely diagnostic.\nHistorically, specific findings described in a retrograde pancreatogram include the main pancreatic duct caliber & contour, clear definitions of its side branches, intraductal filling defects, strictures and cavity formation. Normal MPD caliber & contour is typically described as a smooth, consistent tapering from head to tail23. Normal MPD size is more difficult to definitively determine as it varies with age, race and gender. In a series done in 1982, average sizes of the main duct were 3.6 (head), 2.7 (body) and 1.6 mm (tail)24 with the upper limit of normal up to 5–6 mm. Historically, significant disagreements occurred over interpretations of pancreatogram findings. The Cambridge criteria were an attempt to standardize interpretations of various pancreatogram findings. During this International workshop, pancreatic ductal changes were classified as equivocal, mild, moderate, or severe (see table 5)23. A normal pancreatogram was one without any abnormalities in the MPD or its side branches, an equivocal one would be with <3 side branch abnormalities, where as mild would be 3 or more side branch abnormalities. Moderate and severe would describe findings involving both the main pancreatic duct and side branches. Additionally, pancreatograms with large cavities, filling defects or strictures, irregularity in ductal contour, calcification, and/or organ invasion were classified as severe. However, it is important to note that the Cambridge classification system soley refers to the pancreatic ductal anatomy and does not describe the clinical stage of CP23.\nTable 5.\nCambridge Criteria\n| Grade | Main Pancreatic Duct | Branch Ducts |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Normal | Normal | Normal |\n| Cambridge 1 (equivocal) | Normal | <3 abnormal |\n| Cambridge 2 (mild) | Normal | ≥3 abnormal |\n| Cambridge 3 (moderate) | Abnormal | >3 abnormal |\n| Cambridge 4 (severe) | Abnormal * | >3 abnormal |\nOpen in a new tab\n*Including large cavity >10 mm, Intraductal filling defects, duct obstruction (stricture), duct dilation or irregularity, calculi/pancreatic calcification, or contiguous organ invasion\nAlthough ERCP is sensitive for detection of changes in the pancreatic duct, there are several drawbacks when used for the diagnosis of CP. First, like EUS, it is operator dependent and prone to interobserver variability. Differences in ERCP lie not just in quality of the pancreatogram but also in the interpretation of the images. Next, pancreatograms do not provide assessment of the classic CP changes within the pancreatic parenchyma. Finally, ERCP is the most invasive diagnostic modality and carries post-procedural risks, most notably, post-ERCP pancreatitis. For these reasons, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommended that ERCP only be used for diagnosing CP, once other imaging methods have been exhausted19.\nPancreatic Function Tests\nPancreatic Function Tests (PFTs) are typically classified as indirect (noninvasive) or direct (invasive)32. Indirect PFTs refer to the evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function without direct hormonal stimulation of the gland. Examples of indirect PFTs include serum trypsinogen, fecal elastase, and fecal fat measurements. Direct PFTs involve hormonal stimulation of the pancreas by either secretin or cholcystekinin (CCK).\nAdvantages of indirect PFTs are that they are inexpensive, non-invasive, and easy to perform tests that can be performed on an outpatient basis. One such test is the 72-hour fecal fat collection. Fecal fat collection is not typically used in the diagnostic algorithm for chronic pancreatitis, rather it’s utility lies in grading the degree of exocrine dysfunction in patients with established CP and response to pancreatic enzyme supplementation25. When performed correctly, this is an excellent test at quantifying steatorrhea. However, due to large need for patient cooperation for stool collection and coordination with the laboratory many clinicians avoid this test, particularly in the diagnostic evaluation of CP. A more commonly utilized indirect PFT is the fecal pancreatic elastase-1. In 1999, Gullo et al sought to measure fecal elastase-1 levels in 53 healthy individuals, 44 patient with confirmed CP (further stratified as severe, moderate or mild) and 43 patients with non-pancreatic GI disorders. All healthy subjects and all but 3 subjects with non-pancreatic GI disorders had elastase levels >190 as compared to only 10 of the 44 in the CP group. Of note, 22/22 of the severe chronic pancreatitis had levels <190 mcg/g as compared to only 2/9 classified as mild CP, showing that sensitivity precipitously declines in early CP as compared to severe CP27. It is important to know that other conditions such as small bacterial overgrowth and submission of a non-formed stool specimen can cause false positive test results28. Finally, trypsin is a serologic test that can help detect the underlying etiology of a patient’s steatorrhea. Jacobson et al found that at levels <20 ng/ml, serum trypsinogen was a specific marker of steatorrhea caused by a pancreatic etiology29 and at very high levels (>150 ng/ml) indicate active pancreatic inflammation25. In short, indirect PFTs are helpful as adjunct tests along with imaging suggestive of disease. Alone, intermediate results should not be interpreted as diagnostic for CP6.\nDirect PFTs allow for evaluation of both acinar and ductal pancreatic cells by aspirating duodenal contents after stimulation by either CCK or secretin, respectively30. When stimulated by CCK, pancreatic enzymes are measured in the duodenal contents, and bicarbonate concentration is measured from the fluid following secretin stimulation. In one large retrospective study, patients who had symptoms concerning for CP but no radiographic evidence of disease, had sPFTs (secretin PFTs) completed and subsequently were followed over a number of years to see if they would develop CP. A positive sPFT was defined as <75 mEq/l in duodenal fluid collections (collected at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after stimulation). Seventy patients that were studied had negative sPFT and 20 patients had positive sPFTs30. Of those with positive sPFTs, 9 later developed CP where as of the 70 with negative sPFTs, only 2 patients later developed chronic pancreatitis30. Sensitivity & specificity of diagnosing CP with sPFTs were 82% and 86%, respectively whereas the PPV and NPV were 45% and 97%, respectively30. This suggests primary utility of secretin-stiumlated PFT lies in ruling out CP in patients who present with signs & symptoms concerning for CP, such as chronic abdominal pain.\nDirect PFTs and EUS may have the greatest benefit in helping to diagnose early CP. PFTs may be able to detect exocrine dysfunction suspicious for CP prior to classic imaging changes and EUS, as discussed, may detect early ductal and parenchymal changes suggestive of CP. A study done by Stevens et al in 2009 sought to compare EUS with direct PFTs in the diagnosis of minimal change CP. They showed a 72% concordance between EUS and direct PFT testing in early CP. They also concluded that direct PFTs (specifically sPFT) were more likely to be abnormal earlier on in disease as compared to EUS (using a cut off of >3 criteria)31. Finally, it has been suggested that using both EUS and direct PFTs, in combination, may add more specificity in diagnosis and PFTs may add clarity to those patients with indeterminate EUS findings (2–4 EUS features).\nDifferential Diagnosis of Chronic Pancreatitis\nA critical clinical dilemma occurs in the presence of focal abnormalities in the pancreas, with the primary considerations being pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), focal CP, and autoimmune pancreatitis. Although CP may potentially develop in any location, this commonly occurs in the pancreatic head. The term groove pancreatitis describes the anatomic variant of CP that characteristically involves the pancreatic head, duodenum, and pancreatioduodenal groove32. Focal CP allows for parenchymal sparing which can also be confused with PDAC or other causes of a pancreatic mass33. Many patients with groove pancreatitis develop elevated serum CA19-9 levels due to biliary obstruction or acute inflammation, which further confuses the clinical scenario. Particularly in these scenarios a high index of clinical suspicion for PDAC must be maintained, and patients often require surgical resection due to the inability to exclude malignancy. However, the duct-penetrating sign may provide a means of discriminating between focal CP and PDAC. This sign refers to a non-constricted, patent main pancreatic duct that courses into the area of focal pancreatic enlargement; the presence of a duct-penetrating sign suggests CP rather than PDAC33. Also, pancreatic parenchymal calcifications and an irregular MPD favor CP rather than PDAC6. Patients with focal AIP may have a dramatically elevated serum IgG4 level and/or the presence of characteristic extrapancreatic disease, but undoubtedly have negative fine needle aspiration of the mass and dramatic response to steroid therapy.\nSummary\nIn summary, diagnosing CP can range from routine in those with severe disease and obvious calcifications on CT imaging to elusive in those patients with early changes of CP. The workup of suspected CP should follow a progressively non-invasive to more invasive STEP-wise approach in a patient with a suspicious clinical presentation and risk factors that raise their pre-test probability of disease. After a thorough history and physical exam, basic labs should be obtained such as lipase, amylase, metabolic panel and indirect PFTs (fecal elastase-1, serum trypsin). Computed tomography remains the best initial imaging modality to obtain as it has good sensitivity for severe CP and may obviate the need for other diagnostic tests. When equivocal, an MRCP should be obtained for a more detailed evaluation of the both the pancreatic parenchyma and ducts. If the diagnosis remains in doubt, EUS should be performed with or without pancreas function testing. ERCP remains a last line diagnostic test and seldom should be used outside of therapeutic purposes. Future advances should target optimizing current diagnostic tools to more accurately diagnose early CP, as it is in this population where the benefits of delaying progression of CP may have the most profound effect. Likely the best way at establishing a diagnosis in these patients are via pancreatic function testing in the setting of indeterminate EUS results. Biomarker studies of pancreas fluid may supplement diagnosis.\nTable 4.\nRosemont Criteria14\n| Consistent with Chronic Pancreatitis |\n| :-- |\n|  1 Major A feature and 3 or more minor features |\n|  1 Major A feature and 1 major B feature |\n|  2 Major A features |\n| Probable Chronic Pancreatitis |\n|  1 Major A feature and less than 3 minor features |\n|  1 Major B feature and 3 or more minor features |\n|  5 or more minor features |\n| Indeterminate for Chronic Pancreatitis |\n|  3–4 minor features, no major features |\n|  Major B feature alone or with less than 3 minor features |\n| Normal Pancreas |\n|  Less than 2 minor features, no major features |\nOpen in a new tab\nAcknowledgments\nGrant Support: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Diabetes And Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) under award number U01DK108327 (PH, DC).

Harris, and Michael R. Odom\nCeliac disease may present with a variety of manifestations and develop at any age. This article presents evidence-based answers to common questions about the evaluation and management of celiac disease. July 2022\nAcute Diarrhea in Adults\n_Erica S. Meisenheimer, Carly Epstein, and Derrick Thiel_In the United States, diarrhea accounts for an estimated 179 million outpatient visits, 500,000 hospitalizations, and more than 5,000 deaths annually, resulting in approximately one episode of acute diarrheal illness per person per year. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is typically viral in etiology and is the most frequent presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. July 2022\n2021\nHip Pain in Adults: Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis\nRachel Chamberlain\nHip pain usually localizes anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. A focused history and physical examination can help differentiate the causes of hip pain, which is important for prescribing effective therapy. The history should include personal history of hip problems, sports activities, and injuries; family history of hip problems; and the location and quality of pain, aggravating and alleviating factors, and mechanical symptoms. Physical examination should include evaluation of gait, range of motion, and muscle strength; palpation of the painful area; and special tests as indicated. If imaging is needed, standing radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial test. January 15, 2021\nOnychomycosis: Rapid Evidence Review\nWinfred Taylor Frazier, Zuleica M. Santiago-Delgado, and Kenneth C. Stupka II\nOnychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed, causing brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Confirming the diagnosis with a potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended before initiating treatment, which can include oral or topical therapies. Treatment choice should be based on shared decision-making. October 2021\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome: Questions and Answers for Effective Care\nJohn M. Wilkinson and Margaret C. Gill\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to specific biologic and cellular abnormalities that are not fully understood. Psychological factors do not cause IBS, but many people with IBS also have an anxious or depressed mood, prior adverse life events, or psychosocial stressors. Physicians should understand the concerns and expectations of patients and the models that patients use to explain their illness and should empathetically respond to psychosocial cues. Anxiety related to the unpredictability of symptoms may have a greater effect on quality of life than the symptoms themselves. Patients who meet symptom-based criteria and have no alarm features may be confidently diagnosed with few tests. Treatments should focus on symptom relief and improved quality of life. June 15, 2021\nHome Blood Pressure Monitoring\nJeffrey M. Weinfeld, Kathryn M. Hart, and Jose D. Vargas\nHome blood pressure monitoring can confirm the diagnosis of hypertension after an elevated in-office blood pressure measurement. Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the diagnostic standard for measurement, home blood pressure monitoring is more practical and accessible to patients. September 2021\nTopical Corticosteroids: Choice and Application\nStephen K. Stacey and Mark McEleney\nTopical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions. These medications are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The quantity prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated. March 15, 2021\nHypothyroidism: Diagnosis and Treatment\nStephen A. Wilson, Leah A. Stem, and Richard D. Bruehlman\nClinical hypothyroidism is present in one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence in female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening. More common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic. A diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy. May 15, 2021\nTinnitus: Diagnosis and Management\nSarah N. Dalrymple, Sarah H. Lewis, and Samantha Philman\nTinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an objective internal or external source. Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease, and although it is typically not associated with a dangerous condition, it can significantly affect an individual’s quality of life. Guidelines recommend a standard approach to history and physical examination to determine the etiology, followed by audiometric testing and imaging, laboratory studies, and other testing as appropriate. Cognitive behavior therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve quality of life in patients with tinnitus. Avoidance of noise exposure may help prevent the development or progression of tinnitus. June 1, 2021\nRecent-Onset Altered Mental Status: Evaluation and Management\nBrian Veauthier, Jaime R. Hornecker, and Tabitha Thrasher\nPotential precipitating factors for the recent onset of altered mental status can be multifactorial and include central nervous system insults, systemic infections, metabolic disturbances, toxin exposure, medications, chronic systemic diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Clinicians must quickly identify and treat reversible causes to avoid poor patient outcomes. November 2021\nCare of the College Student\nBrian K. Unwin, Jeffrey Goodie, Brian V. Reamy, and Jeffrey D. Quinlan\nAlthough generally healthy, about 20% of students who attend college have special health care needs, including asthma, diabetes mellitus, and learning, mental health, and substance use disorders. Physicians can facilitate the transition of a youth to an adult model of health care by using structured processes to orient the youth to self-care. August 2021\nEating Disorders in Primary Care: Diagnosis and Management\nDavid A. Klein, Jillian E. Sylvester, and Natasha A. Schvey\nEating disorders are potentially life-threatening conditions characterized by disordered eating and weight-control behaviors that impair physical health and psychosocial functioning. Up to 8% of females and 2% of males are affected during their lifetimes. At least one-third of persons with disordered eating develop persistent symptoms that remain 20 years postdiagnosis. Co-occurring mood, anxiety, substance use, personality, or somatic disorders are identified in more than two-thirds of persons with eating disorders. Early intervention with symptom improvement decreases the risk of a protracted course and long-term pathology. January 1, 2021\nUnintentional Weight Loss in Older Adults\nHeidi L. Gaddey and Kathryn K. Holder\nUnintentional weight loss in people older than 65 years is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment should focus on feeding assistance, addressing contributing medications, providing appealing foods, and social support. July 2021\nThe Preparticipation Physical Evaluation\nJames MacDonald, Marie Schaefer, and Justin Stumph\nThe preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a common primary care medical visit for young athletes. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics published updated PPE recommendations. The general goals outlined in these guidelines include determining general physical and psychological health; evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions; and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The PPE should include a structured physical examination with focus on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Consideration should be taken to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. May 1, 2021\nInterpreting SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Tests: Common Questions and Answers\nWilliam D. Nettleton\nThe spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results, especially when performed more than five days after the onset of symptoms. This article addresses common questions about SARS-CoV-2 testing and presents an approach to interpreting diagnostic test results. April 15, 2021\nHealth Maintenance for Women of Reproductive Age\nHeather L. Paladine, Himabindu Ekanadham, and Daniela C. Diaz\nThis article focuses on screening and counseling for health conditions that are more prevalent in, or have a unique impact on, women, transgender men, and nonbinary individuals of reproductive age. Health issues including cardiovascular risk factors, obesity, hypertension, cancer, depression, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and unhealthy drug and alcohol use should be considered. To have the greatest impact on health, physicians should focus on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade A and B recommendations with patients. February 15, 2021\nBipolar Disorders: Evaluation and Treatment\nGabrielle Marzani and Amy Price Neff\nBipolar disorders are common mental health conditions of variable severity that are difficult to diagnose. New diagnostic criteria and specifiers with attention on mixed features and anxious distress aid the physician in recognizing episode severity and prognosis. Early recognition and treatment of bipolar disorders improve outcomes. Physicians should consider bipolar disorder in any patient presenting with depression. Pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers is a first-line treatment that should be continued indefinitely because of the risk of patient relapse. Active lifestyle approaches include good nutrition, exercise, and sleep hygiene. Monotherapy with antidepressants is contraindicated during episodes with mixed features, manic episodes, and in bipolar I disorder. Psychotherapy is a useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Patients and their support systems should be educated about the chronic nature of the illness, possible relapse, suicidality, environmental triggers, and the effectiveness of early intervention. February 15, 2021\nPeripheral Nerve Entrapment and Injury in the Upper Extremity\nSabrina Silver, Christopher C. Ledford, Kendall J. Vogel, and James J. Arnold\nPeripheral nerves in the upper extremities are at risk of injury and entrapment because of their superficial nature and length. Injury can result from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, systemic disease, and entrapment. Most peripheral nerve injuries seen by family physicians will involve neurapraxia, resulting from entrapment along the anatomic course of the nerve. History and physical examination alone are often enough to identify the injury or entrapment; advanced diagnostic testing with magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, or electrodiagnostic studies helps to confirm the clinical diagnosis and is indicated if conservative management is ineffective. Initial treatment is conservative, with surgical options available for refractory injuries or entrapment caused by anatomic abnormalities. March 1, 2021\nNutrition Support Therapy\nMary N. R. Lesser and Lenard I. Lesser\nNutrition support therapy is the delivery of formulated enteral or parenteral nutrients to maintain or restore nutrition status. Family physicians can provide nutrition support therapy to patients at risk of malnutrition when it would improve clinical outcomes or quality of life. Physicians should initiate a thorough nutrition screening and assessment to determine an individual’s nutrition status and the potential need for nutrition support therapy. December 2021\nAlcohol Withdrawal Syndrome: Outpatient Management\nSamuel M. Tiglao, Erica S. Meisenheimer, and Robert C. Oh\nApproximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can lead to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. September 2021\nTelemedicine Management of Musculoskeletal Issues\nNicole T. Yedlinsky and Rebecca L. Peebles\nTelemedicine has become a valuable tool during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Musculoskeletal issues are a common reason for primary care visits and can often be managed using telemedicine, especially if a standardized approach is used. This article discusses telemedicine methods and techniques, including visit preparation, virtual history collection and physical examination, and initial treatment options. Findings from the virtual history and physical examination usually suggest a likely diagnosis. However, physicians should have a low threshold for proceeding with further evaluation, including in-person visits, if the diagnosis or initial management is unclear. February 1, 2021\nInitiating Hormonal Contraception\nRuth Lesnewski\nMost patients can safely begin using hormonal contraception at any point during their menstrual cycle. A flexible, patient-centered approach to initiating contraception promotes health and enhances patients’ reproductive autonomy. A recent Papanicolaou test is not necessary before prescribing hormonal contraception. Most patients can begin using progestin-only contraceptives immediately after childbirth. Delaying contraception to wait for the next menses or for an appointment creates unnecessary barriers for patients. Clinicians can facilitate the use of hormonal contraception by providing anticipatory guidance about common side effects, giving comprehensive information about available contraceptive choices, honoring patients’ preferences, and eliminating office-related barriers. March 1, 2021\n2020\nOutpatient Management of Covid-19: Rapid Evidence Review\nAnthony Cheng, Dominic Caruso, and Craig McDougall\nWhen possible, patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 should be triaged via telehealth before they receive in-person care. There are no evidence-based treatments appropriate for use in the outpatient setting; management is supportive and should include education about isolation. In hospitalized patients, remdesivir should be considered to reduce time to recovery, and low-dose dexamethasone should be considered in patients who require supplemental oxygen. October 15, 2020 [Updated March 1, 2021]\nManaging Hypertension Using Combination Therapy\n_Dustin K. Smith, Robert P. Lennon, and Peter B. Carlsgaard\n_Most adults with primary hypertension will eventually require treatment with at least two antihypertensive agents. This article focuses on combination therapy—when to initiate it, choice of agents, and special populations whose comorbid conditions influence those choices. March 15, 2020\nAcute Chest Pain in Adults: Outpatient Evaluation\nJohn R. McConaghy, Malvika Sharma, and Hiten Patel\nApproximately 1% of primary care office visits are for chest pain. Initial evaluation is based on determining whether the patient needs to be referred to a higher level of care to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Age, sex, and type of chest pain can predict the likelihood of coronary artery disease. Patients with suspicion of ACS should be transported to the emergency department. Those with low or intermediate risk can undergo outpatient testing. In those with low suspicion for ACS, consider costochondritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety states. Other less common considerations include acute pericarditis, pneumonia, and heart failure. December 15, 2020\nFunctional Dyspepsia: Evaluation and Management\n_Anne Mounsey, Amir Barzin, and Ashley Reitz\n_Dyspepsia affects up to 30% of the general population in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with 70% of patients having functional dyspepsia. Symptoms include postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Perform a dyspepsia endoscopy for patients 60 years or older. For patients younger than 60 years, a test and treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is recommended before acid suppression therapy. All patients should be advised to limit foods associated with increased symptoms of dyspepsia. January 15, 2020\nManagement of Hypertriglyceridemia: Common Questions and Answers\nRobert C. Oh, Evan T. Trivette, and Katie L. Westerfield\nHypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and severely elevated triglyceride levels increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Management starts with lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline or intermediate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Icosapent can be added in patients at high cardiovascular risk if triglyceride levels remain high despite statin use. Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin may be considered in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. September 15, 2020\nNeck Pain: Initial Evaluation and Management\nMarc A. Childress and Samantha Jayne Stuek\nThe broad differential diagnosis for neck pain requires an efficient but global assessment. Emphasis is typically placed on red flags that can assist in the early recognition and treatment of more concerning diagnoses, such as traumatic injuries, infection, malignancy, vascular emergencies, and other inflammatory conditions. August 1, 2020\nAtopic Dermatitis: Diagnosis and Treatment\nWinfred Frazier and Namita Bhardwaj\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin disease that causes intensely pruritic skin lesions. Maintenance therapy consists of liberal use of emollients and daily bathing with soap-free cleansers. Use of topical corticosteroids is the first-line treatment for flare-ups, with or without the addition of a calcineurin inhibitor. Ultraviolet phototherapy is a safe and effective second-line treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. March 15, 2020\nUrinary Tract Infections in Young Children and Infants: Common Questions and Answers\nBrian Veauthier and Michael V. Miller\nThe decision to test for urinary tract infection should be based on risk factors and the child’s age. Urinalysis can help rule out infection and inform decisions about when to start antibiotics. However, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. September 1, 2020\nTickborne Diseases: Diagnosis and Management\nEmma J. Pace and Matthew O'Reilly\nThe incidence of tickborne disease is increasing in the United States. Patients presenting with flulike symptoms during the spring and summer months should be evaluated for a tickborne disease. Treatment based on experience and observation is recommended for tickborne diseases that fit the clinical presentation and geographic distribution of the disease. Early treatment with doxycycline has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic treatment after tick exposure in patients without symptoms is generally not recommended. May 1, 2020\nManagement of Fever in Infants and Young Children\nJennifer L. Hamilton, Susanna G. Evans, and Munish Bakshi\nFebrile illness in children younger than 36 months is a concern with potentially serious consequences. Factors include poor arousability and increased respiratory effort. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infections in these children. Antibiotic choice should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance. June 15, 2020\nShort-Term Systemic Corticosteroids: Appropriate Use in Primary Care\nEvan L. Dvorin and Mark H. Ebell\nShort-term systemic corticosteroids are frequently prescribed for adults by primary care physicians; however, short courses of the steroids are associated with adverse effects, including hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, mood disturbance, sepsis, and fracture. There is evidence against corticosteroid use in patients with acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, carpal tunnel, and allergic rhinitis and for its use in patients with Bell palsy and acute gout. There is insufficient evidence supporting its use for patients with pharyngitis, lumbar radiculopathy, and herpes zoster. January 15, 2020\nFrequent Headaches: Evaluation and Management\nAnne Walling\nRepeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable and difficult to treat. Learn which red flag features to watch for that could signal serious underlying pathology. April 1, 2020\nGout: Rapid Evidence Review\nKarl T. Clebak, Ashley Morrison, and Jason R. Croad\nRisk factors of gout include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; and a diet rich in meat, seafood, and fructose-rich food and beverages. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa. Diagnosis is made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids all relieve pain in acute episodes. Indications for chronic urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flares per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. November 1, 2020\nChronic Diarrhea in Adults: Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis\nKristina Burgers, Briana Lindberg, and Zachary J. Bevis\nCommon causes of chronic diarrhea include irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and microscopic colitis. The differential diagnosis for chronic diarrhea is broad; however, a thorough history and physical examination can narrow the diagnostic evaluation. April 15, 2020\nBasal Cell and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas: Diagnosis and Treatment\nJonathon M. Firnhaber\nKeratinocyte carcinoma is the most common skin cancer malignancy found in humans. It is comprised of basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.  The increasing incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is primarily in older patients and is attributed to cumulative ultraviolet light exposure. September 15, 2020\nOutpatient Burn Care: Prevention and Treatment\nJason S. Lanham, Nicole K. Nelson, Bryan Hendren, and Teneisha S. Jordan\nFor all types of minor burn injuries, the goal of initial treatment is to minimize the extent of the burn, clean the wound, and address pain. The burn surface should be cooled with running tap water. Although superficial burns do not require dressings, advanced dressings should be used for partial-thickness burns to promote reepithelization and protect the wound. Patients with full-thickness burns should be immediately referred to a burn center. April 15, 2020\nPeripheral Neuropathy: Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis\nGregory Castelli, Krishna M. Desai, and Rebecca E. Cantone\nPeripheral neuropathy is one of the most common neurologic problems encountered by family physicians. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies, although many cases are idiopathic. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. December 15, 2020\nPoint-of-Care Ultrasonography\nMichael J. Arnold, Christopher E. Jonas, and Rachel E. Carter\nPoint-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) reduces cost, radiation exposure, and imaging delays, and increases patient satisfaction. POCUS is useful in resource-limited settings, and the use of POCUS in primary care is increasing. March 1, 2020\nSepsis: Diagnosis and Management\nRobert Gauer, Damon Forbes, and Nathan Boyer\nTo improve sepsis diagnosis, which can be challenging, clinicians must obtain historical, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data supportive of infection and organ dysfunction. After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, the sepsis bundle should be initiated (fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, lactate measurement, and cultures) within three hours of presentation. Vasopressor therapy is needed if fluid resuscitation is ineffective. April 1, 2020\nChronic Musculoskeletal Pain: Nonpharmacologic, Noninvasive Treatments\nDiane M. Flynn\nBecause no individual therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain has consistent benefit, a multimodal treatment approach is recommended. Many nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatment approaches yield small to moderate improvement in pain and function. This article summarizes the evidence for these therapies, which can be used with pharmacologic or more invasive modalities. October 15, 2020\n2019\nTreatment of the Common Cold\nKatharine C. DeGeorge, Daniel J. Ring, and Sarah N. Dalrymple\nAcute upper respiratory tract infection, also called the common cold, is the most common acute illness in the United States. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of this illness can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that are unlikely to help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and intranasal ipratropium. The only safe and effective treatments for children are analgesics, acetylcysteine, honey, nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and menthol rub. September 1, 2019\nType 2 Diabetes Therapies: A STEPS Approach\nJoshua Steinberg and Lyndsay Carlson\nSeveral recent large randomized controlled trials have significantly improved physicians’ knowledge about the impact of medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus on patient-oriented outcomes. A concise and organized way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, effectiveness, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term effectiveness on patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control. February 15, 2019\nMigraine Headache Prophylaxis\nHien Ha and Annika Gonzalez\nMany patients with episodic migraine headaches would benefit from preventive therapy, which reduces frequency, severity, and distress from migraines; preventive therapy could improve quality of life and prevent chronic migraines. Indications for preventive therapy include four or more headaches a month, eight or more headache days a month, debilitating headaches, and medication-overuse headaches. Several first- and second-line medications are available for treatment; identifying and managing environmental, dietary, and behavioral triggers can also be useful. Relaxation training, thermal biofeedback, electromyographic feedback, and cognitive behavior therapy have good evidence as nonpharma­cologic ways to prevent episodic migraines. January 1, 2019\nAnticoagulation: Updated Guidelines for Outpatient Management\nPatricia Wigle, Brad Hein, and Christopher R. Bernheisel\nVitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are commonly used for the prevention and treatment of systemic embolism associated with atrial fibrillation, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin and select direct oral anticoagulants can be used for anticoagulation therapy initiation on an outpatient basis. Indications for anticoagulation therapy, direct oral anticoagulant therapy, and recommendations from guidelines are addressed in this article. October 1, 2019\nPatellofemoral Pain Syndrome\nDavid Y. Gaitonde, Alex Ericksen, and Rachel C. Robbins\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome, a common cause of knee pain in adolescents and adults younger than 60 years, can cause limitations in daily physical activity and ability to exercise if undiagnosed. The cardinal feature of patellofemoral pain syndrome is pain in or around the anterior knee that intensifies when the knee is flexed during weight-bearing activities. The diagnosis is clinical, and pain with squatting is the most sensitive physical examination finding. Treatment includes rest, a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy with strengthening exercises. January 15, 2019\nPlantar Fasciitis\nThomas Trojian and Alicia K. Tucker\nPlantar fasciitis is common in runners but can also affect sedentary people. Risk factors include limited ankle dorsiflexion, increased body mass index, and standing for prolonged periods of time. Symptoms are stabbing, nonradiating pain first thing in the morning in the proximal medioplantar surface of the foot; the pain becomes worse at the end of the day. Treatment should start with stretching of the plantar fascia, ice massage, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Many conservative treatments have not shown benefit over placebo. Recalcitrant plantar fasciitis can be treated with injections, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, or surgical procedures. June 15, 2019\nAcne Vulgaris: Diagnosis and Treatment\nLinda K. Ogé, Alan Broussard, and Marilyn D. Marshall\nTypical acne lesions involve the pilosebaceous follicles and the inter­related processes of sebum production, Cutibacterium acnes colonization, and inflammation. Treatment is based on severity and usually includes topical agents such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and antibiotics. Oral antibiotics and isotretinoin may be used for severe, recalcitrant acne. Combination oral contraceptives and spironolactone are also used in some patients. Further study is needed to determine the effectiveness of complementary therapies and physical modalities such as laser therapy and light therapy. October 15, 2019\nCurrent Concepts in Concussion: Initial Evaluation and Management\nKeith A. Scorza and Wesley Cole\nConcussion results from trauma to the head; it affects individuals physically, cognitively, and emotionally/behaviorally and is a major health concern. Headache is the most common symptom. Spine and serious brain injuries should be ruled out before diagnosis. Symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, balance tests, and sideline assessment tools are used for diagnosis and monitoring recovery. Athletes with suspected concussion should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest is the preferred management. Individuals should gradually return to activities, but those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately following injury, may require longer recovery periods. April 1, 2019\nUrinary Incontinence in Women: Evaluation and Management\nJocelyn S. Hu and Elyse Fiore Pierre\nUrinary incontinence (UI) is a common problem in women, resulting in economic burden and decreased quality of life. The Women’s Preventive Services Initiative is the only major organization that recommends annual screening for UI in all women. Initial evaluation should determine whether incontinence is transient or chronic, the subtype of the incontinence, and whether any findings warrant subspecialist referral. Pelvic floor strengthening and lifestyle modifications are first-line recommendations for all UI subtypes. No medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of stress incontinence; antimuscarinic medications may be prescribed for urge incontinence. Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred for more invasive management. September 15, 2019\nHand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease: Rapid Evidence Review\nAaron Saguil, Shawn F. Kane, Rebecca Lauters, and Michael G. Mercado\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease is most commonly caused by enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16. Clinical diagnosis is based on the presentation of a low-grade fever with a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet, and by painful oral ulcerations. The largest incidence of the disease is within the first five years of life, and most cases occur in patients younger than 10 years. Handwashing, specifically after diaper changes and toileting, and before eating, helps stop the spread of the disease. October 1, 2019\nAbnormal Uterine Bleeding in Premenopausal Women\nNoah Wouk and Margaret Helton\nAbnormal uterine bleeding is a common symptom in reproductive-aged women. The acronym PALM-COEIN facilitates the classification of bleeding, with PALM referring to structural etiologies (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia), and COEIN referring to nonstructural etiologies (coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, not otherwise classified). Evaluation includes a detailed history and pelvic examination, as well as laboratory testing to rule out anemia and pregnancy. Endometrial sampling should be performed in patients 45 years and older, and in younger patients with a significant history of unopposed estrogen exposure. To avoid surgical risks and preserve fertility, medical management is the preferred initial approach for most hemodynamically stable patients. April 1, 2019\nKidney Stones: Treatment and Prevention\nLeonardo Ferreira Fontenelle and Thiago Dias Sarti\nIn patients with suspected kidney stones, the first priority is to rule out conditions requiring immediate referral to an emergency department, then to alleviate pain. The diagnostic workup consists of urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess for conditions requiring active stone removal. Conservative management consists of pain control, medical expulsive therapy with an alpha blocker, and follow-up imaging to monitor stone position and assess for hydronephrosis. Asymptomatic kidney stones should be followed with serial imaging and should be removed if they become larger or if symptoms, urinary obstruction, or infection occurs. All patients with kidney stones should be screened for risk of stone recurrence. April 15, 2019\nOtitis Media: Rapid Evidence Review\nHeidi L. Gaddey, Matthew Thomas Wright, and Tracy N. Nelson\nAcute otitis media, the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits, can cause ear pain, fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting and lethargy. Acute otitis media is diagnosed in children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and recent-onset ear pain or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment usually consists of pain management and antibiotics. However, observation with deferment of initial antibiotics is an option in some children without severe symptoms. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of acute otitis media. September 15, 2019\nGastroenteritis in Children\nScott Hartman, Elizabeth Brown, Elizabeth Loomis, and Holly Ann Russell\nAcute gastroenteritis, defined as a diarrheal disease of rapid onset, with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain, is not a major cause of death in the United States but leads to significant morbidity. Physical examination is the best way to assess hydration. Mild to moderate dehydration can be treated with oral rehydration therapy. Half-strength apple juice followed by preferred fluids may be used for mild dehydration, and an oral rehydration solution with or without an antiemetic should be used for moderate dehydration. Hospitalization and intravenous rehydration are recommended for children who do not respond to oral rehydration therapy plus an antiemetic and patients with severe dehydration. February 1, 2019\nInfluenza: Diagnosis and Treatment\nDavid Y. Gaitonde, Faith C. Moore, and Mackenzie K. Morgan\nThe hallmark of influenza infection is abrupt onset of fever, cough, chills or sweats, myalgias, and malaise. For most patients in the outpatient setting, the diagnosis is made clinically, and laboratory confirmation is not necessary. Laboratory testing may be useful in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza and in patients for whom a confirmed diagnosis will change treatment decisions. Rapid molecular assays are the preferred diagnostic tests. Treatment with one of four approved anti-influenza drugs may be considered if the patient presents within 48 hours of symptom onset.

Wilkinson, Elizabeth W. Cozine, and Conor G. Loftus\nGas, bloating, and belching are most often caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders. Psychological distress often makes the symptoms worse. Exhaustive testing is not necessary for diagnosis. Most patients are classified as having gastric or small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders, with functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation being the most common causes. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease, and patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. March 1, 2019\nAcute Hand Infections\nCaitlyn M. Rerucha, John T. Ewing, Kathryn E. Oppenlander, and Wesley Charles Cowan\nAny trauma to the hand, particularly a penetrating trauma, may introduce damaging pathogens. Superficial infections occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas deep infections can involve the tendon sheaths, adjacent anatomic compartments, deep fascial planes, bursae, joint spaces, and bones. Superficial hand infections are more common than deep infections and are typically managed with elevation, warm soaks, splinting in the position of function, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics when indicated. Clenched-fist bite wounds result from direct contact of the fist on incisor teeth and are associated with polymicrobial infections. Empiric antibiotics and prompt surgical consultation are indicated to reduce long-term morbidity. February 15, 2019\nErythema Multiforme: Recognition and Management\nKathryn P.

High-quality surveillance endoscopies and biopsies can decrease cancer risk; however, overuse of endoscopy and inadequate biopsy sampling is common and may unnecessarily expose patients to procedural risk and increased costs.\nBased on AGA’s Barrett’s esophagus clinical guidance, the AGA quality team has developed two quality measures to guide you in providing high-quality care while minimizing patient risk.\nQuality measures to track\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) interval for patients with non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus.\nProviders should adhere to surveillance endoscopy intervals of three to five years for patients with nondysplastic Barrett’s esophagus and avoid inappropriate shorter or longer intervals (i.e., less than three years or greater than five years).\n\nMeasure specification\nMeasure implementation flow chart\n\nSystematic biopsies during surveillance EGD in patients with Barrett’s esophagus.\nDuring surveillance upper endoscopy for patients with non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus, four-quadrant systematic biopsies should be taken every 1-2 centimeters along the entire length of Barrett’s esophagus.\n\nMeasure specification\nMeasure implementation flow chart\n\nQuantifiable process and proposed outcome measures to track\n\nProcess measure: Percentage of patients with nondysplastic Barrett’s esophagus who undergo surveillance endoscopy in three to five years.\nProcess measure: Percentage of patients with nondysplastic Barrett’s esophagus who are evaluated with systematic four-quadrant biopsies every 1-2 cm along the Barrett’s esophagus segment during their surveillance endoscopy.\nProposed outcome measure: Percentage of patients with Barrett’s esophagus under surveillance who develop EAC.\n\nUse our measure implementation flow charts:\n\n\nLearn more about AGA’s quality measures and view our complete list of quality resources.\n\nStay in the know with AGA\nMembers receive our weekly newsletter, AGA eDigest, which is packed with clinical education updates, career development opportunities, member news and more.\nStay connected.

This poses significant challenges on precise literature retrieval for author name queries, a common behavior in biomedical literature search. In response, we present a comprehensive dataset of disambiguated authors. Specifically, we complement the automatic PubMed Computed Authors algorithm with the latest ORCID data for improved accuracy. As a result, the enhanced algorithm achieves high performance in author name disambiguation, and subsequently our dataset contains more than 21 million disambiguated authors for over 35 million PubMed articles and is incrementally updated on a weekly basis. More importantly, we make the dataset publicly available for the community such that it can be utilized in a wide variety of potential applications beyond assisting PubMed’s author name queries. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for best practices of authors pertaining to use of their names.\nAvailability and implementation\nThe PubMed Computed Authors dataset is publicly available for bulk download at: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/ComputedAuthors/. Additionally, it is available for query through web API at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/authors/.\n1 Introduction\nAs a popular biomedical literature search portal, PubMed indexed more than 36 million articles by the end of 2023 and serves about 2.5 million users for 3 million queries and 9 million page views on an average working day (Fiorini et al. 2018a). Among its daily queries, approximately one-third of them include author names (Islamaj Dogan et al. 2009). However, an author name search is often not able to precisely retrieve all and only publications of the author because author names can be ambiguous: different authors could have the same name, or the same author could have different names or use different name forms. Our analysis shows that over 55% of author names in PubMed articles are ambiguous. To address these challenges, the Computed Authors (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/mj12/mj12_pm_author_ranking.html) was introduced in 2012 to provide users improved results on searching publications of a specific author when the author name of an article is clicked. The Computed Authors uses advanced machine learning algorithms to disambiguate authors of PubMed articles and achieves an accuracy over 90% even though it is limited by the size and characteristics of its training data and the difficulties in handling certain ambiguous cases (Liu et al. 2014).\nTo cope with ambiguous author name issues, ORCID (the Open Researcher and Contributor ID; https://orcid.org/), a registry-based system, was also created in 2012 to provide persistent and unique digital identifiers for individual researchers (Haak et al. 2012). In the past few years, ORCID has gained increasing popularity and enabled a number of author-centric services (Butler 2012, Gao and Zhou 2017, McNutt et al. 2018, Sansone et al. 2019, Bohannon 2017). Over 17 million ORCID profiles had been registered by September 2023, with more than 2.5 million annual registrations in recent years (Montenegro 2023).\nAccordingly, we found the usage of ORCID in PubMed articles has been increasing remarkably since 2012, reaching nearly 2.7 million unique ORCIDs used in more than 3.7 million PubMed articles by the end of 2023, with annual increase of about 700 000 articles in the last 3 years. However, despite its rapid growth, the use of ORCID in PubMed publications remains modest overall. Only 10% of all PubMed articles contain ORCIDs and over 50% of new articles added to PubMed in 2023 did not use any ORCIDs. The proportion of PubMed articles with ORCIDs has become essentially constant since 2021. Among the articles with ORCIDs, on average only ∼2 authors use ORCIDs. Nearly 90% of these articles used ORCID for either the first or the last author, and about 50% of such papers contain ORCIDs only of the first or the last author. We also observed that many authors tend to use ORCIDs in a sporadic manner and do not consistently use ORCID in their papers after their first use of ORCID. In fact, the more articles an author publishes, the less likely the author uses his/her ORCID throughout.\nThere are challenges in authors’ usage of the ORCID system. A large number of authors have not yet registered in the ORCID system. Over 40% of existing ORCID records have not been actively updated (ORCID 2022) and many existing profiles contain missing or outdated information. Many authors are not using their ORCID consistently in their papers. These facts show that the ORCID system is not yet an adequate solution for solving ambiguous author name issues. However, with the increasing use of ORCID, we hypothesize that ORCIDs and the Computed Authors can be complementary to each other. On the one hand, ORCIDs, when available, can be used to provide valuable data to assess and improve computational approaches. On the other hand, the Computed Authors algorithms are good at generating and updating author-publication links at scale without human effort, which is necessary to provide comprehensive coverage and can be used for quality improvement of ORCID profiles with human assistance.\nWe thus integrated ORCIDs into the Computed Authors algorithms to improve its accuracy, developed a large dataset of disambiguated authors for all PubMed articles and have made it publicly available. In the following sections, we present a summary of the improved Computed Authors, its quality and different use cases. We also propose some best practices for authors pertaining to their names. We believe the combined use of the Computed Authors and other resources will greatly benefit the broader scientific community in practice.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Data and data sources\nWe used profiles in the summaries of the ORCID Public Data File 2023 downloaded from ORCID (https://orcid.figshare.com/articles/dataset/ORCID_Public_Data_File_2023/24204912) for our analysis of ORCID. We developed a dataset of the Computed Authors in the second week of January 2024 based on all articles added to PubMed before 1 January 2024 for evaluating the quality of the Computed Authors and sampled 40 000 disambiguated authors who are associated with ORCIDs from the dataset for evaluating its accuracy and analyzing consistency of ORCID usage in PubMed articles.\nIn a separate analysis, we used the gold standard dataset of 1900 publication pairs (GSD1900) created by Vishnyakova et al. (2019) for benchmarking performance of the Computed Authors algorithm. This dataset of publication pairs is not completely random as pairs considered to be easy for disambiguation were excluded.\n2.2 Integration of ORCID into the computed authors algorithm\nLeveraging metadata from PubMed articles, including PubMed-specific features such as grants, substances, and MeSH terms, the Computed Authors employs machine learning algorithms to determine whether a pair of articles within a namespace (a name space is a group of authors with the same last name and first name initial) is attributed to a single author or to different authors, then merges the articles into distinct groups corresponding to individual authors using agglomerative clustering methods (Liu et al. 2014). With the increasing use of ORCIDs in PubMed publications, ORCIDs were integrated into its algorithms for improvement of accuracy around 2018. Specifically, within a namespace, two articles with the same ORCID are grouped into one cluster regardless their computed pairwise probability, while two articles with different ORCIDs are split into different clusters. However, it is not uncommon for an author to have multiple ORCIDs and use them in different publications. Thus, we keep articles with different ORCIDs together when they meet two conditions: (i) the computed pairwise probability is above 0.99 (a threshold we determined based on manually examined results); and (ii) the author’s affiliation and name information matches between the two articles.\n2.3 Evaluating improvement of the computed authors\nUsing the 40 000 author samples, we compared the set of associated articles with the same ORCID versus those obtained by PubMed’s Computed Authors algorithm. When a set of articles belonging to a single ORCID are separated into multiple Computed Authors clusters, it is considered a splitting error. Conversely, when a Computed Authors cluster contains articles from two or more separate ORCIDs, it is counted as a merging error. Note that both splitting and merging errors can occur for the same ORCID author. The splitting and merging error rates for the Computed Authors without integration of ORCIDs were obtained from Table 5 in Liu et al. (2014).\n3 Results\n3.1 The improved computed authors algorithm\nThe Computed Authors algorithms without integration of ORCIDs had achieved comparable performance for disambiguating authors in all PubMed articles in scale compared to algorithms used for the high-quality Author-ity 2009 dataset (Torvik and Smalheiser 2009, Liu et al. 2014, Sanyal et al. 2021). Integration of ORCIDs further improved overall accuracy of the Computed Authors by significantly reducing splitting errors (errors of splitting articles of one author into different clusters, reduced from 7.7% to 3.6%) with moderately increased merging errors (errors of merging articles of different authors into one cluster, increased from 2.2% to 5.3%). Our examination of a sample of 40 000 disambiguated authors with ORCIDs showed that over 91% of them are error free, which is improved compared to the previously reported accuracy (Liu et al. 2014). The total error rate decreased by about 10% (decreased from 9.9% to 8.9%). We believe accuracy of the Computed Authors is under-estimated because the merging errors are over-calculated since one author could have multiple ORCIDs. Our examination of a random sample from the clusters with merging errors shows that over 60% of them actually have no merging errors, but correctly cluster authors who have multiple ORCIDs.\nTo examine authors with different characteristics in the Computed Authors, we manually reviewed authors of the top 20 Asian surnames and authors of the top 20 western surnames in the 40 000 samples and found authors of Asian names have much higher error rates. We also found authors with more publications have higher error rates compared to authors with less publications.\nTo evaluate performance of the Computed Authors improved algorithm, we used the gold standard dataset of 1900 publication pairs (GSD1900) created by Vishnyakova et al. (2019) as benchmark and compared the Computed Authors’ performance to their model and the Author-ity 2018 dataset (Torvik and Smalheiser 2021). As shown in Table 1, the Computed Authors achieved better precision than the other two algorithms. Compared to the Author-ity 2018 dataset, the Computed Authors achieved comparable F1 score and accuracy on the test data of 400 pairs but slightly inferior F1 score and accuracy on the overall dataset. We believe the improvement in the Author-ity 2018 dataset over the results of Author-ity 2009 are explained by its additional access to external data (e.g. use of imported data from the Grants database maintained by NIH and/or from Google Scholar).\nTable 1.\nComparison of performance on the GSD1900 dataset.\n|  | Test data of 400 pairs\n\n| Total 1900 pairs\n\n|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | GSD1900 Modela | Computed Authorsb | Author-ity 2018b | Computed Authorsb | Author-ity 2018b |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Precision | 0.827 | 0.956 (0.918, 0.980) | 0.898 (0.852, 0.934) | 0.967 (0.955, 0.977) | 0.931 (0.916, 0.945) |\n| Recall | 0.922 | 0.898 (0.850, 0.935) | 0.972 (0.941, 0.990) | 0.888 (0.869, 0.905) | 0.979 (0.969, 0.987) |\n| F1 | 0.872 | 0.926 (0.899, 0.951) | 0.934 (0.909, 0.956) | 0.926 (0.914, 0.937) | 0.955 (0.946, 0.963) |\n| Accuracy | – | 0.922 (0.891, 0.947) | 0.925 (0.894, 0.949) | 0.910 (0.896, 0.922) | 0.940 (0.929, 0.951) |\nOpen in a new tab\naPerformance of the model reported in Vishnyakova et al.

Table 2 lists statistics of the Computed Authors at the end of 2023 compared to the Author-ity 2018 dataset.\nTable 2.\nSummary of disambiguated authors in the Computed Authors versus Author-ity 2018.\n|  | Computed Authors (2023) | Author-ity 2018 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total articles (PMIDs, million) | 35.7 | 28.5 |\n| Total author instances (million) | 163.2 | 114.2 |\n| Total disambiguated authors (million) | 21.3 | 13.7 |\n| Disambiguated authors with ORCIDs (million) | 2.6 | 1.1 |\n| Total unique ORCIDs (million) | 2.5a | 1.1 |\nOpen in a new tab\naBecause some ORCIDs are shared by multiple authors, the total number of unique ORCIDs (2.5 m) is less than the total number of disambiguated authors (2.6 m).\nWe update the Computed Authors on a weekly basis. Every week, we run the Computed Authors algorithms to decide if a new PubMed article can be assigned to an existing disambiguated author for each of the authors listed on the article. For any author that has no existing disambiguated author for assigning the article, a new disambiguated author is created. Incremental updates enable the Computed Authors to provide the most up-to-date disambiguated authors for all articles added to PubMed. To make the Computed Authors available and accessible to the broader scientific community, we publish it through an API for query and index the data for easy retrieval. We also provide the complete Computed Authors data for bulk download through an FTP service.\n3.2 Use cases\nThe Computed Authors have been powering PubMed’s author name queries since 2012. It has greatly improved author name query experience for PubMed users. Measuring the click-through-rate (CTR) with which users continued to click on the search results, we found that PubMed users’ CTR increased substantially from 26.3% (without the Computed Authors) to 39.5% (with the Computed Authors) (Fiorini et al. 2018b). With its new accessibility through API and FTP, the Computed Authors can further serve a wider variety of applications, including the following use cases.\n3.2.1 Update of ORCID profiles\nAs many ORCID profiles are not actively updated or contain missing or outdated information (Verma et al. 2023), updating these profiles through manual curation can be laborious and time consuming. With the Computed Authors available through our API, one can more easily retrieve all publications in PubMed that are relevant to a particular author. The latest information available on these publications can then be used to update the ORCID profiles and improve the quality of ORCIDs.\nOur analysis shows that the adoption of ORCIDs by PubMed authors is still not pervasive overall. Many authors do not yet use ORCIDs. Even for authors with ORCIDs, the number of publications linked to their ORCIDs represents a small fraction of their total publications. Hence, for authors with PubMed articles not associated with their ORCIDs, the articles missing from their profiles can be added computationally by leveraging the Computed Authors. In addition, the missing affiliations in ORCID profiles can also be assisted computationally by using the institutional information from an author’s latest publication in PubMed when available. We also identified two cases where ORCID quality can be improved by the Computed Authors: (i) unification of multiple ORCIDs used by the same author; and (ii) correction of an ORCID mistakenly linked to an author. Using the Computed Authors for correction of these inconsistencies will improve ORCIDs’ quality.\n3.2.2 Track records of publications\nKeeping publication records can be a daunting task for many authors. Searching publications on PubMed or other sources by author name query is usually not effective in finding the precise results. The Computed Authors presents a good resource for keeping track of publications, giving the authors an option for tracking their up-to-date publication records and retrieval of their publications for use of different purposes, such as display on their personal pages.\nThe Computed Authors available through API have been indexed on both PMIDs and author names for easy and straightforward retrieval of an author’s entire publications through queries in the form of “last name and first initial” and a PMID of any of his/her publications. When an author changes his/her names, it is also possible to retrieve all his/her publications published under different names by simply concatenating queries of different names using a comma (“,”) as delimiter. After a list of PMIDs is retrieved from the Computed Authors, it can be used to acquire all relevant information of each article for display on a personal page when coupled with the PubMed API (https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi) and/or the iCite API (https://icite.od.nih.gov/api). This will provide the authors a centralized place for tracking their author impact metrics and gathering evidence of their research impact.\n3.2.3 Construction of academic knowledge graphs\nWith the rapid advancement of scientific research and publication, building academic knowledge graphs has become critical to express the semantic elements and discourse structures contained in the publications for quick retrieval of the accumulated knowledge (Verma et al. 2023). As a key component of academic publications, authors play an important role in the construction of academic knowledge graphs, and disambiguated authors are fundamental in knowledge alignment for building an academic knowledge graph for better performance in downstream applications such as search and recommendation systems, quantification of bibliometrics and author impact, as well data analytics (Gong et al. 2024). Authors have been integrated as entities in several publicly available academic knowledge graphs such as the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG) (Färber and Ao 2022) and the Open Academic Graph (OAG) (Zhang et al. 2023) in the broader scholarly field, and the PubMed Knowledge Graph (PKG) (Xu et al. 2020) in a specific domain. However, these academic knowledge graphs have suffered from ambiguous authors or not being updated with the latest disambiguated authors. The Computed Authors available for bulk download through the FTP service can be used to improve knowledge alignment of these graphs, update the graphs with the latest disambiguated authors, or even construct a new academic knowledge graph.\n4 Discussion and conclusion\nIn this study, we introduced the Computed Authors that have been integrated into the rich bibliographic search options available in PubMed since 2012. It is now made available for query through the API (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/authors/) and for bulk download through FTP service (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/ComputedAuthors/). Through in-depth analysis, we show that the use of ORCIDs by PubMed authors is on a fast rise but has only a modest impact on the author name ambiguity challenge. We further find that ORCIDs and the Computed Authors are complementary and can benefit from each other. With integration of ORCID into the Computed Authors algorithms, we increased accuracy of the Computed Authors. In return, our improved results can be beneficial and play an important role in a variety of real-life use cases such as improving author searches in PubMed, helping authors curate their own publication record, facilitating portfolio analysis and research on individual authors/institutions (Ioannidis et al. 2019), as well as complementing other author-publication sources such as ORCID.\nUnlike some other existing disambiguated author datasets provided by Aminer (https://www.aminer.cn/), Semantic Scholar (S2) (https://www.semanticscholar.org/), and OpenAlex (https://openalex.org/) (Zhang et al. 2018, Priem et al. 2022, Subramanian et al. 2022), our Computed Authors focuses on a specific domain and applies domain specific features in its algorithms for higher accuracy. In comparison to Author-ity 2018, a dataset developed based on PubMed articles (Torvik and Smalheiser 2021) with high quality (Sanyal et al. 2021), the Computed Authors achieves comparable accuracy and contains the latest disambiguated authors of all PubMed articles, with regular updates. Using a gold standard dataset of 1900 publication pairs (GSD1900) created by Vishnyakova et al. (2019) as benchmark, the Computed Authors achieved higher precision but 3% lower F1 and accuracy compared with Author-ity 2018. We judge precision as especially important for application in PubMed searching.\nAdvances of author name disambiguation algorithms in recent years have focused on general techniques without considering the specific challenges and features of PubMed articles. None of these advancements have been applied for disambiguating authors at the scale achieved by the Computed Authors (Rodrigues et al. 2024). Our method is producing results better than or comparable to more recent advanced algorithms (Vishnyakova et al. 2019). Also, our results on PubMed are comparable to the best results on the WhoIsWho data (Chen et al. 2023). Even though these are different datasets, WhoIsWho covers a broad range of scientific fields, including the biomedical field.\nAlthough the Computed Authors have reported an accuracy over 90%, they are generally limited by the size and characteristics of existing training data. The alteration of authors’ names, a practice not uncommon in academia, also introduces additional challenges to the algorithm (Gaskins and McClain 2021). Performing clustering within each namespace limits abilities of the algorithm in dealing with change of author names. Despite our best efforts, automatically computed author results remain imperfect in some difficult cases where consistent use of author names can play an important role in their disambiguation. Our analysis discovers that ORCID is particularly helpful in addressing these challenges. We thus strongly recommend that authors take the following best practices in use of their names and use their ORCIDs persistently in their publications, particularly when their affiliations, research topics or other critical information have changed:\n\n\nUse the same name form consistently.\n\n\nUse your affiliation consistently.\n\n\nUse full name including the middle name if any (not just initials).\n\n\nKeep the ORCID profile up-to-date and consider using ORCID whenever possible.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank ORCID for providing their data freely available to the community.
