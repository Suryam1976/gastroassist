# Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices and considerations for GastroAssist, a medical question-answering system that handles sensitive healthcare queries.

## Overview

Security is paramount for medical applications like GastroAssist. This guide covers key security considerations including data protection, API security, deployment security, and compliance requirements.

## Data Security

### Medical Data Handling

GastroAssist processes medical queries and retrieves information from various sources. While it doesn't store patient-specific information by default, these practices should be followed:

1. **Zero Retention Policy** (Default Configuration):
   - Queries are processed in-memory and not persisted
   - Generated answers are not stored
   - Source information is cited but not cached long-term

2. **If Implementing History Features**:
   - Explicitly inform users about data retention
   - Implement proper data encryption (at rest and in transit)
   - Provide data deletion options
   - Consider anonymization techniques

### Encryption

1. **Data in Transit**:
   - Use HTTPS for all API communication
   - Configure TLS 1.3 when possible
   - Implement HSTS headers

2. **Data at Rest**:
   - Encrypt database with industry-standard algorithms
   - Use encrypted environment variables for secrets
   - Implement disk encryption for production servers

### API Keys and Credentials

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store API keys and credentials as environment variables
   - Never hardcode secrets in source code
   - Use different keys for development and production
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Consider using a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
   - Implement least privilege access for all credentials
   - Audit access to credentials regularly

## API Security

### Authentication and Authorization

While the current GastroAssist implementation doesn't include user authentication, consider these measures if implementing user accounts:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect
   - Use industry standards like JWT for tokens
   - Enforce strong password policies
   - Consider multi-factor authentication for admin access

2. **API Authentication**:
   - Require authentication for all API endpoints
   - Implement API key validation
   - Consider using request signing for sensitive operations

3. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Define user roles (user, admin, etc.)
   - Restrict access based on roles
   - Implement principle of least privilege

### Request Validation

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Use Pydantic models for schema validation

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Set appropriate limits for different endpoints
   - Consider different limits for authenticated vs. anonymous users

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Restrict allowed origins
   - Limit allowed methods and headers
   - Use appropriate CORS policies based on deployment scenario

## Deployment Security

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Server Hardening**:
   - Use up-to-date OS and software
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Use a firewall to restrict access

2. **Container Security**:
   - Use minimal base images
   - Scan containers for vulnerabilities
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Implement read-only file systems where possible

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use private networks for internal communication
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary ports only
   - Consider using a WAF for additional protection

### Monitoring and Logging

1. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Implement alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review logs for security incidents

2. **Secure Logging**:
   - Avoid logging sensitive information
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies
   - Secure access to logs
   - Consider using a SIEM solution for production

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop an incident response plan
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Establish communication channels
   - Practice incident scenarios

## External Service Security

### Third-Party APIs

GastroAssist uses external APIs like OpenAI and Tavily. Consider these security measures:

1. **API Usage**:
   - Validate responses from external APIs
   - Implement timeouts and circuit breakers
   - Have fallback mechanisms for API failures
   - Monitor usage for unexpected behavior

2. **Data Sharing**:
   - Review terms of service for all APIs
   - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
   - Be aware of how third parties handle your data
   - Limit the data shared to what is necessary

### Content Security

1. **Source Validation**:
   - Validate sources used for medical information
   - Prioritize reputable medical sources
   - Implement source credibility scoring
   - Be transparent about information sources

2. **Answer Validation**:
   - Implement medical accuracy checks
   - Include appropriate disclaimers
   - Avoid providing diagnostic advice
   - Clearly cite sources for all medical information

## Healthcare Compliance

### HIPAA Considerations

While GastroAssist is primarily an information system rather than a patient data system, if deployed in a healthcare setting, consider HIPAA compliance:

1. **Technical Safeguards**:
   - Implement access controls
   - Use encryption for data in transit and at rest
   - Maintain audit logs
   - Implement automatic logoff

2. **Administrative Safeguards**:
   - Conduct risk assessments
   - Develop and implement policies and procedures
   - Provide security awareness training
   - Have a contingency plan

3. **Physical Safeguards**:
   - Implement facility access controls
   - Define workstation security protocols
   - Control physical access to servers and data

### Other Regulatory Considerations

Depending on deployment region and context, also consider:

1. **GDPR Compliance** (Europe):
   - Implement data minimization
   - Provide mechanisms for data subject rights
   - Maintain records of processing activities
   - Have a legal basis for processing

2. **CCPA/CPRA Compliance** (California):
   - Disclose data collection practices
   - Provide opt-out mechanisms
   - Honor consumer rights requests
   - Implement reasonable security measures

## Security Testing

### Regular Security Assessments

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Scan code for security vulnerabilities
   - Use automated tools like OWASP ZAP or Snyk
   - Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Address findings promptly

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Conduct regular penetration tests
   - Test both application and infrastructure
   - Address findings based on risk level
   - Maintain a history of test results

3. **Code Security Reviews**:
   - Perform regular security-focused code reviews
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Check for common security pitfalls
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
