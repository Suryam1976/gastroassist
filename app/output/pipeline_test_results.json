Heartburn is a symptom of acid reflux and GERD, commonly described as a burning feeling in your chest after you eat. However, they may lead to acid reflux or GERD, which can cause epigastric pain or heartburn. This condition may result from acid reflux, which can cause epigastric pain. If an underlying condition such as GERD, Barrett\u2019s esophagus, or peptic ulcer disease is causing your epigastric pain, you\u2019ll likely require acid-blocking medications.

PubMed uses multiple tools to help you find relevant results:\n\nBest Match sort order uses a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm to place the most relevant citations at the top of your results.\nAn autocomplete feature displays suggestions as you type your search terms. This feature is based on PubMed query log analysis described in \" Finding Query Suggestions for PubMed .\"\nA spell checking feature suggests alternative spellings for search terms that may include misspellings.\nA citation sensor displays suggested results for searches that include terms characteristic of citation searching, e.g., author names, journal titles, publication dates, and article titles.\n\nI retrieved too many citations.

How can I expand my search?\n\nOn the abstract page for a citation, see the Similar Articles section for a pre-calculated set of additional PubMed citations closely related to that article.\nRemove extraneous or specific terms from the search box.\nTry using alternative terms to describe the concepts you are searching.\n\nFind a specific citation\nPaste the article title into the search box, or enter citation details such as the author, journal name and the year the article was published in the search box and the PubMed citation sensor will automatically analyze your query for citation information to return the correct citation. The citation sensor incorporates a fuzzy matching algorithm and will retrieve the best match even if a search includes an incorrect term. You do not need to use field tags or Boolean operators.\nSearching by author\nEnter the author\u2019s last name and initials without punctuation in the search box, and click Search.\nIf you only know the author\u2019s last name, use the author search field tag [au], e.g., brody[au].\nNames entered using either the lastname+initials format (e.g., smith ja) or the full name format (john a smith) and no search tag are searched as authors as well as collaborators, if they exist in PubMed.\nEnter a full author name in natural or inverted order, e.g., julia s wong or wong julia s.\n\nPrior to 2002, full author names were not included on PubMed citations, so full author name searches will only retrieve citations from 2002 forward, when the full author name was published in the article.\u00a0\nA comma following the last name for searching is optional. For some names, however, it is necessary to distinguish which name is the last name by using the comma following the last name, e.g., james, ryan.\n\nOmit periods after initials and put all suffixes at the end, e.g., vollmer charles jr\nInitials and suffixes are not required. If you include a middle initial or suffix, you will only retrieve citations for articles that were published using the middle initial or suffix.\nMore information about author searching:\n\nTo search by author using the search builder, click Advanced search\u00a0and then select Author from the All Fields menu. The author search box includes an autocomplete feature.\nYou may click an author link on the abstract display to execute a search for the author in PubMed. Results will display using a ranking algorithm if the author name is computationally similar for additional PubMed citations.\nIf an author name includes only stopwords, use the author search field tag [au] to search in combination with other terms, e.g., just by[au] seizure.\nAuthor names are automatically truncated to account for varying initials and designations such as Jr. To turn off the truncation, use double quotes around the author's name with the author search field tag [au], e.g., \"smith j\"[au].\nUse the search field tag [1au] to search for the first personal author or [lastau] to search for the last personal author name in a citation.\n\nFor additional information on author names in PubMed, please see the journal article, \"Author Name Disambiguation for PubMed.\"\nSearching by journal\nEnter one of the following in the search box:\n\nfull journal title (e.g., molecular biology of the cell)\ntitle abbreviation (e.g., mol biol cell)\nISSN number, a standardized international code (e.g., 1059-1524)\n\nMore information about journal searching:\n\nTo search by journal using the search builder,\u00a0click Advanced search\u00a0and then select Journal from the All Fields menu. The journal search box includes an autocomplete feature.\nTo find full journal names, use the NLM Catalog, or mouseover the journal title abbreviation on the citation (available in abstract view).\nClick Journals in NCBI Databases on the PubMed homepage.\nEnter the journal name and click Search.\n\n\nUse the journal search field tag [ta]\u00a0to limit your search to the journal only, e.g., gene therapy[ta], scanning[ta]\nSearching with the full journal title or abbreviation is recommended for complete retrieval of indexed items; older citations may not have an ISSN.\nIf a journal title or abbreviation includes a special character (e.g., parentheses, brackets, &), enter the title or abbreviation without the special characters. For example, to search by the journal abbreviation j hand surg [am], enter j hand surg am.\nSearching for a journal will automatically map to the official journal title and the title associated with an alternative title, if one exists. To turn off this automatic mapping enter the journal in double quotes and tag with [ta], e.g., \"science\"[ta].\n\nA list of journals included in PubMed is available by FTP.\nSearching by date\n\nUsing the results timeline\nUsing the search builder\nSearching by a single date in the search box\nSearching for a date range in the search box\nSearching for a relative date range\n\nUsing the results timeline\nClick and drag the sliders on the Publication Date timeline to change the date range for your search.\nNote: The Publication Date timeline counts all publication dates for a citation as supplied by the publisher, e.g., print and electronic publication dates. These dates may span more than one year; for example, an article that was published online in November 2018 and published in a print issue in January 2019. This means the sum of results represented in the timeline may differ from the search results count.\nUsing the search builder\n\nClick Advanced search\u00a0and use the search builder.\nSelect a date field from the All Fields menu, e.g., Date \u2013 Publication, and enter a single date or a date range in the fill-in-the-blank boxes. Month and day are optional. If you want to search for a date range up to the current date, do not edit the \u2018Present\u2019 date box.\nAdd the date from the builder to the query box.\nOnce you have finished adding terms to the query box, click Search (or Add to History) to run the search.\n\nSearching by a single date in the search box\nEnter dates using the format yyyy/mm/dd [date field]. The month and day are optional.\nUse a Boolean operator when combining a date with other search terms.\nExample\nUse the Boolean operator AND to limit your search to a specific publication date.\ncancer AND 2020/06/01[dp]\nThe available date fields are:\n\nDate of Publication [dp] - Date searching includes both print and electronic dates of publication. Searching for a single date does not include items when the electronic date of publication is after the print date.\nElectronic Date of Publication (if applicable) [epdat]\nPrint Date of Publication (if applicable) [ppdat]\nEntry Date [edat] - Date used for PubMed processing, such as \u201cMost Recent\u201d sort order.\nMeSH Date [mhda] - The date the citation was indexed with MeSH terms.\nCreate Date [crdt] - The date the PubMed record was first created.\n\nSearching for a date range in the search box\nEnter date ranges using a colon (:) between each date followed by a [date field].\nUse a Boolean operator when combining a date range with other search terms.\nExample\nUse the Boolean operator AND to limit your search to a date range.\nheart disease AND 2019/01/01:2019/12/01[dp]\nComprehensive searches for a full year should be entered as 2000:2000[dp] rather than 2000[dp] to retrieve citations with a different print and electronic year of publication.\nDate range searching includes both print and electronic dates of publication.\nSearching for a relative date range\nUse the following format to search for a relative date range:\n\nterm=\"last X days\"[date field]\nterm=\"last X months\"[date field]\nterm=\"last X years\"[date field]\n\nwhere X is the number of days, months or years immediately preceding today\u2019s date and [date field] is the date field tag: [dp], [edat] or [crdt].\nThe relative date range search for publication dates will also include citations with publication dates after today's date; therefore, citations with publication dates in the future will be included in the results.\nFilters\nYou can use filters to narrow your search results by publication date, text availability, article attribute, article type, article language, species, sex, age, and other.\nTo apply a filter:\n\nRun a search in PubMed.\nClick the filter you would like to activate from the sidebar. A check mark will appear next to the activated filter(s).\u00a0\nSubsequent searches will be filtered until the selected filters are turned off, or until your browser data is cleared.\nA green \"Filters applied\" message will display at the top of the results page when filters are applied to your search.\n\nThe most frequently used filters appear on the sidebar by default. More filters are available for some categories:\n\nClick the \"See all \u2026 filters\" link for a filter category.\nA pop-up menu will appear showing all available filters for that category.\nSelect the filter(s) you would like to apply to your search.\nTo cancel your selections, click Cancel or click on the X in the upper right corner to close the pop-up and return to your search results.\n\n\nClick Apply. This will close the pop-up menu, apply the selected filter(s) to your search, and display your selection(s) on the sidebar.\nThe selected filter(s) will appear on the sidebar in addition to the default filters until your browser cookies are cleared, or you click the \"Reset filters display\" button at the bottom of the sidebar.\n\n\n\nClearing applied filters:\n\nTo turn off all currently applied filters, click the \"Clear filters\" link in the green \"Filters applied\" message at the top of the page, or click the \"Clear all filters\" button at the bottom of the sidebar.\nTo turn off individual filters, click the filter on the sidebar.\nTo reset the filters shown on the sidebar to the default filter list, click the \"Reset filters display\" button at the bottom of the sidebar. This will also clear any currently applied filters.\n\nMore information about filters:\n\nMany filters under the Additional Filters section limit your search results to citations that have been assigned specific MeSH terms during MEDLINE indexing. This means these filters may exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms.\nSee Filter search strategies for the equivalent PubMed query for each filter.\nYou can activate additional filters with My Custom filters. Once activated, these filters will appear at the top of your sidebar under \"My Custom Filters\".\n\nPublication date filters\nTo filter your results by Publication Date, click 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, or enter a custom range. These filters include both electronic and print publication dates.\nText availability filters\nTo filter your results to only citations that include a link to full text, a link to free full text, or an abstract, click the appropriate selections.\nAlternatively, you may search for citations with links to full text, free full text or include an abstract using the values: full text[sb], free full text[sb], or 'hasabstract'. No search field tag is required for hasabstract. You may also search for all citations with a structured abstract with \u2018hasstructuredabstract\u2019.\nNote: Most citations in PubMed to articles published before 1975 do not include abstracts.\nArticle attribute filter\nUse the associated data filter to find citations that include secondary source databanks and accession numbers. These data links connect to records in other NLM databases (for example: GenBank, ClinicalTrials.gov) or external data repositories (for example: figshare, Dryad). Data links are provided by the publisher and/or by data repositories through participation in NCBI\u2019s LinkOut service.\nArticle type filters\nUse article type filters to narrow your results based on the content or style of the article, such as: Clinical Trial or Review. Article types are also called publication types.\nYou can add more article type filters to the sidebar using the \"See all article type filters\" link. The complete list of publication types found in PubMed is available.\nArticle type filters rely on citations' Publication Type [pt] data except for the Systematic Review filter, which uses a search strategy in addition to the publication type.\nPublication type data may be supplied by the publisher or assigned during the MEDLINE indexing process. Therefore, these filters may exclude some citations that have not yet completed the MEDLINE indexing process.\nSystematic reviews\nTo search for systematic reviews in PubMed, use the Systematic Review article type filter on the sidebar, or enter your search terms followed by AND systematic[sb] in the search box. For example, lyme disease AND systematic[sb].\nThe Systematic Review filter uses a search strategy in addition to the Systematic Review publication type [pt] to find systematic reviews in PubMed. To limit your search to only those citations with the Systematic Review publication type, use the publication type search tag[pt], i.e., systematic review[pt]; however, this may exclude some relevant citations that have not yet completed the MEDLINE indexing process.\nArticle language filters\nLanguage filters restrict your search to articles published in the selected language(s). You can add more language filters to the sidebar using the \"See all article language filters\" link.\nBy default, PubMed displays English language titles and abstracts when provided by the publisher. Check the Abstract display for links to view the abstract in other languages (when available).\nArticle language filters are located under the Additional Filters section.\nSpecies filters\nSpecies filters restrict your results to human or animal studies:\n\nHumans\nOther Animals\n\nSpecies filters limit your search results to citations that were assigned the associated MeSH terms for species during MEDLINE indexing. These filters will typically deliver precise results but can also exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms on their PubMed record. For example, some citations are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as preprints, Online Ahead of Print citations, and U.S. government-funded research published in journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE.\nSpecies filters are located under the Additional Filters section.\nSex filters\nSex filters restrict your search results to a specific sex for an animal or human study:\n\nFemale\nMale\n\nSex filters limit your search results to citations that were assigned the associated MeSH terms for sex during MEDLINE indexing. These filters will typically deliver precise results but can also exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms on their PubMed record. For example, some citations are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as preprints, Online Ahead of Print citations, and U.S. government-funded research published in journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE.\nSex filters are located under the Additional Filters section.\nAge filters\nAge filters restrict results to a specific age group for a human study.\nAge filters limit your search results to citations that were assigned the associated MeSH terms for age during MEDLINE indexing. These filters will typically deliver precise results but can also exclude some otherwise relevant results that do not include the associated MeSH terms on their PubMed record. For example, some citations are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as preprints, Online Ahead of Print citations, and U.S. government-funded research published in journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE.\nAge filters are located under the Additional Filters section. You can add more age filters to the sidebar using the \"See all age filters\" link.\nAge filters include:\n\nChild: birth-18 years\nNewborn: birth-1 month\nInfant: birth-23 months\nInfant: 1-23 months\nPreschool Child: 2-5 years\nChild: 6-12 years\nAdolescent: 13-18 years\nAdult: 19+ years\nYoung Adult: 19-24 years\nAdult: 19-44 years\nMiddle Aged + Aged: 45+ years\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\nAged: 65+ years\n80 and over: 80+ years\n\nOther filters & more subsets\nExclude preprints\nThe Exclude preprints filter will exclude preprint citations from your search results. Alternatively, you can exclude preprints from your search results by including NOT preprint[pt] at the end of your query.\nSee Preprints for more information about preprint citations in PubMed.\nThe Exclude preprints filter is located under the Additional Filters section.\nMEDLINE Subset\nThe MEDLINE filter limits results to citations that are indexed for MEDLINE. To use this filter in a query, add medline[sb] to your search.\nThe MEDLINE filter is located under the Additional Filters section.\nPubMed Central Subset\nTo restrict retrieval to citations that have a free full text article available in PubMed Central (PMC), search \"pubmed pmc\"[sb].\nUse the PMID/PMCID/NIHMSID Converter to convert IDs for publications referenced in PubMed and PMC. To retrieve citations that include an NIHMS ID use the query, hasnihmsid.\nCitation Status Subsets\nThe citation status indicates the internal processing stage of an article in the PubMed database (see PubMed Citation Status Subsets).\nTo search for a particular citation status, enter one of the search terms below followed by the [sb] search tag:\n\npublisher\ninprocess\nmedline\npubmednotmedline\n\nTo search for the total number of PubMed citations, enter all[sb] in the search box.\nAhead of Print Citations\nPublishers may submit citations for articles that appear on the web prior to their publication in final or print format. To search for these ahead-of-print citations, enter pubstatusaheadofprint.\nSearching for a phrase\nMany phrases are recognized by the subject translation table used in PubMed's Automatic Term Mapping (ATM). For example, if you enter fever of unknown origin, PubMed recognizes this phrase as a MeSH Term.\nYou can bypass ATM and search for a specific phrase using the following formats:\n\nEnclose the phrase in double quotes: \"kidney allograft\"\nIf you use quotes and the phrase is not found in the phrase index, the quotes are ignored and the terms are processed using automatic term mapping. The message \"Quoted phrase not found in phrase index\" will display at the top of your search results.\n\n\nUse a search tag: kidney allograft[tw]\nIf you use a search tag and the phrase is not found in the phrase index,\u00a0the phrase will be broken into separate terms. For example, \"psittacine flight\" is not in the phrase index, so a search for psittacine flight[tw] is broken up and translated as: (((\"psittaciformes\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"psittaciformes\"[All Fields]) OR \"psittacine\"[All Fields]) OR \"psittacines\"[All Fields]) AND \"flight\"[Text Word]\n\n\nUse a hyphen: kidney-allograft\nIf you use a hyphen and the phrase is not found in the phrase index, the search will not return any results for that phrase.\nHyphenated phrases matching a MeSH term or entry term will include those terms in the search translation. If you want to prevent such mapping, put the hyphenated phrase inside double quotes: \"heart-attack\"\n\n\n\nWhen you enter search terms as a phrase, PubMed will not perform automatic term mapping that includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy. For example, \"health planning\" will include citations that are indexed to the MeSH term, Health Planning, but will not include the more specific terms, e.g., Health Care Rationing, Health Care Reform, Health Plan Implementation, that are included in the automatic MeSH mapping.\nPhrase index\nPubMed uses a phrase index to provide phrase searching. To browse the phrase index, use the Show Index feature included in the Advanced Search builder: select a search field, enter the beginning of a phrase, and then click Show Index.\nQuoted phrase not found\nPhrases may appear in a PubMed record but not be in the phrase index. To search for a phrase that is not found in the phrase index, use a proximity search with a distance of 0 (e.g., \"cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis\"[tiab:~0]); this will search for the quoted terms appearing next to each other, in any order.\nAutomated processes regularly add new phrases to the index based on standard criteria such as phrase frequency and length. If you would like to request a phrase be added to the phrase index, please write to the NLM Help Desk.\nWildcards and truncation\nTo create a wildcard search in PubMed, use an asterisk (*) to substitute for 0 or more characters in a term or phrase. For example, \"vaccin* schedul*\" will find results that include \"vaccine schedule\", \"vaccine scheduling\", \"vaccination schedules\", and more variations of this phrase.\n\nA wildcard (*) substitutes for 0 or more characters\nTerms must begin with at least 4 characters before the first wildcard: colo*\nMultiple wildcards can be used in the same term: organi*ation*\n\nTo use wildcards in a phrase search, use any of the following formats:\n\nEnclose the phrase in double quotes: \"breast feed*\"\nUse a search tag:\u00a0breast feed*[tiab]\nUse a hyphen:\u00a0breast-feed*\u00a0\n\nPhrases can include more than one wildcard: \"colo* cancer*\"\nWildcards turn off Automatic Term Mapping (ATM) and the process that includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy. For example, \"heart attack*\" will not map to the MeSH term Myocardial Infarction or include any of the more specific terms, e.g., Myocardial Stunning; Shock, Cardiogenic.\nWildcards can be particularly useful to capture variations of a phrase, since phrase searches already turn off automatic term mapping and do not otherwise include alternate spellings or singular/plural forms. For example, searching for \"tumo*r associated macrophage*\" retrieves variations of the phrase such as: \"tumor associated macrophage\", \"tumour associated macrophage\", \"tumor associated macrophages\", and \"tumour associated macrophages\".\nCombining search terms with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\nPubMed applies an AND operator between concepts, e.g., \"vitamin c common cold\" is translated as vitamin c AND common cold. Enter Boolean operators in uppercase characters to combine or exclude search terms:\n\nAND retrieves results that include all the search terms.\nOR retrieves results that include at least one of the search terms.\nNOT excludes the retrieval of terms from your search.\n\nPubMed processes searches in a left-to-right sequence. Use parentheses to \"nest\" concepts that should be processed as a unit and then incorporated into the overall search.\n\nPubMed uses automatic term mapping to identify concepts. For example, for the search air bladder fistula, PubMed will search \"air bladder\" as a phrase. If you do not want this automatic phrase parsing, enter each term separated by the Boolean operator AND, e.g., air AND bladder AND fistula.\nSearch Details show how a search was translated.\n\nUsing search field tags\nYou can search for a term in a specific field by including a search field tag after the term; for example, UCLA[ad] will search for the term \u201cUCLA\u201d in the affiliation field only.\nMore information about using search field tags:\n\nThe search field tag must be enclosed in square brackets.\nCase and spacing do not matter: crabs [mh] = Crabs[mh].\nSearch field tags turn off Automatic Term Mapping (ATM), limiting your search to the specified term only.\nUsing a search field tag after multiple terms will attempt to search those terms as a phrase: kidney allograft[tiab].\nTo search multiple terms in the same field, each term must be tagged individually: covid-19[ti] vaccine[ti] children[ti].\nThe Advanced Search builder can help you search for terms in specific fields and build large, complex search strings.\n\nSearch field tags\n\nAffiliation [ad]\nAll Fields [all]\nArticle Identifier [aid]\nAuthor [au]\nAuthor Identifier [auid]\nBook [book]\nComment Correction Type\nCompletion Date [dcom]\nConflict of Interest Statement [cois]\nCorporate Author [cn]\nCreate Date [crdt]\nEC/RN Number [rn]\nEditor [ed]\nEntry Date [edat]\nFilter [filter] [sb]\nFirst Author Name [1au]\nFull Author Name [fau]\nFull Investigator Name [fir]\nGrants and Funding [gr]\nInvestigator [ir]\nISBN [isbn]\nIssue [ip]\nJournal [ta]\nLanguage [la]\nLast Author Name [lastau]\nLocation ID [lid]\nMeSH Date [mhda]\nMeSH Major Topic [majr]\nMeSH Subheadings [sh]\nMeSH Terms [mh]\nModification Date [lr]\nNLM Unique ID [jid]\nOther Term [ot]\nOwner\nPagination [pg]\nPersonal Name as Subject [ps]\nPharmacological Action [pa]\nPlace of Publication [pl]\nPMCID and MID\nPMID [pmid]\nPublication Date [dp]\nPublication Type [pt]\nPublisher [pubn]\nSecondary Source ID [si]\nSubset [sb]\nSupplementary Concept [nm]\nText Words [tw]\nTitle [ti]\nTitle/Abstract [tiab]\nTransliterated Title [tt]\nVolume [vi]\n\nProximity searching\nYou can use proximity searching to search for multiple terms appearing in any order within a specified distance of one another in the [Title], [Title/Abstract], or [Affiliation] fields.\nTo create a proximity search in PubMed, enter your terms using the following format:\n\"search terms\"[field:~N]\n\nSearch terms = Two or more words enclosed in double quotes.\nThere is no limit to the number of words you can search together in proximity; however, the more terms you enter, the more restrictive your search becomes. Using the Boolean operator AND to combine terms may be more appropriate than combining many terms into one proximity search.\n\n\nField = The search field tag for [Title], [Title/Abstract], or [Affiliation] fields.\nProximity searching is only available in the Title, Title/Abstract, and Affiliation search fields.\nYou can use the full search field tags [Title], [Title/Abstract], and [Affiliation], or the abbreviated versions [ti], [tiab], and [ad].\n\n\nN = The maximum number of words appearing between your search terms.\nWhat N value to use will depend on your search. Try changing the N value and comparing the results to find what works best for your search.\nA higher N creates a broader, more comprehensive search; this will typically retrieve more results overall, but some of these results may be less relevant. Using the Boolean operator AND to combine terms may be more appropriate than proximity searching with a large N value.\nA lower N creates a narrower, more precise search; this will typically retrieve fewer results that are highly relevant, but may exclude other relevant results.\nIf N=0, the quoted terms will appear next to each other--with no other words in between.\nFor the affiliation field only, an N value of 1,000 or less will search for the double quoted terms together within the same affiliation, rather than spread across all affiliations on the record. See Affiliation [ad] for an example proximity search in the affiliation field and more information about searching for affiliations.\n\n\n\nMore information about proximity searching:\n\nResults will include your quoted terms in any order. If you would like to search for an exact phrase with terms appearing in a specific order, use a phrase search instead.\nAutomatic Term Mapping is not applied to the quoted terms.\nProximity searching is not compatible with wildcards (*). If the double quoted terms in a proximity search include a wildcard (*), the proximity operator will be ignored.\nYou can combine proximity searches with other terms using Boolean operators; for example, \"hip pain\"[Title:~4] AND stretching\nBooleans and stopwords included in quoted terms for proximity search are searched like regular keywords.\n\nExample\nSearch PubMed for citations with the terms \"rationing\" and \"healthcare\" appearing within 2 words of each other--in any order--in the Title field:\n\"rationing healthcare\"[Title:~2]Search results may include: rationing healthcare, healthcare rationing, rationing of healthcare, rationing in healthcare, rationing universal healthcare, rationing strategies in healthcare, rationing limited healthcare\u2026 and more.\nExample\nSearch PubMed for citations with the terms \"patient,\" \"physician,\" and \"relationship\" appearing next to each other\u2014in any order\u2014in the Title/Abstract fields:\n\"patient physician relationship\"[Title/Abstract:~0]Since N=0, the quoted terms must appear next to each other with no other words in between them, although they can still appear in any order.\nExample\nYou can build queries that combine proximity searches with other terms using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT):\n\"accidental overdose\"[Title/Abstract:~3] AND acetaminophen \"patient physician relationship\"[tiab:~0] OR \u201cpatient doctor relationship\u201d[tiab:~0]\nDisplay, Sort, and Navigate\n\nUnderstanding your search results\nDisplay an abstract\nChanging the display format of search results\nShowing more results\nSorting your results\nFinding the full text article\nFigures\nSimilar articles\nCited by\nReferences\nGrants and funding\nNavigating searches with more than 10,000 results\nDiscovering related data in NCBI databases\nFind related resources using LinkOut\nReporting broken or problem links\n\nUnderstanding your search results\nCitations are initially displayed 10 items per page and sorted by Best Match.\nBy default, PubMed search results are displayed in a summary format and include\u00a0snippets from the citation abstract. Snippets and highlighted terms are selected based on relatedness to your query.\nTo see the abstract for an individual citation, click the title of the citation to go to its abstract page.\nJournal names are shown using the journal title abbreviation. When viewing citations in Abstract format, you can mouseover a journal\u2019s title abbreviation to display the full journal name.\nDisplay an abstract\nClick the title of the citation to go to its abstract page, or change the search results display to Abstract format using the Display options button in the upper right corner of the search results page.\nPubMed may include non-English abstracts if supplied by the publisher. The abstract text defaults to English when a citation has an accompanying non-English abstract. Links to display the additional language(s) are available on the Abstract display. To retrieve citations with non-English abstracts, use the query hasnonenglishabstract.\nChanging the display format of search results\nResults are displayed in the summary format by default, except a single citation result will go directly to the abstract page. You can change the results format using the Display options button:\n\nClick the Display options button in the upper right corner of the search results page\nSelect the display format you would like to use\nResults will be displayed in the new format\n\nSelecting one or more items and changing the display format will display only the selected result(s) in the new format.\nBy default, the summary format includes\u00a0snippets from the citation abstract. You can turn off snippets under Display options by deselecting Abstract snippets.\nShowing more results\nThe results page indicates the total number of items retrieved.\nTen items are displayed per page by default. You can change the number of items displayed per page using the Display options button:\n\nClick the Display options button in the upper right corner of the search results page\nSelect the number of items to display per page: 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200\nYour selection will be active for subsequent searches until your browser cookies are cleared.\n\nClick \"Show more\" to display the next page of results, or click \"Jump to page\" to navigate directly to a specific page of results.\nSorting your results\nThe default sort order in PubMed is Best Match. You can use the \"Sort by\" drop-down menu at the top of the search results page to change the sort order.\nIf you change the sort order, your new selection will be active for subsequent searches until your browser cookies are cleared.\nSort orders\nYou can sort your search results by:\n\nBest Match: The Best Match sort order is based on an algorithm that analyzes each PubMed citation found with your search terms. For each search query, \"weight\" is calculated for citations depending on how many search terms are found and in which fields they are found. In addition, recently-published articles are given a somewhat higher weight for sorting. The top articles returned by the weighted term frequency algorithm above are then re-ranked for better relevance by a new machine-learning algorithm. Please see the Algorithm for finding best matching citations in PubMed for more information.\nMost Recent: Citations sorted by Most Recent are displayed in reverse date added order: last in, first out. The Most Recent date is the date a record was initially added to PubMed, not the publication date. The secondary sort is PMID.\nPublication Date: Citations sorted by Publication Date are displayed in reverse chronological order: newest to oldest. Citations with more than one publication date, such as electronic and print, are sorted by their earliest publication date. Publication dates without a month are set to January, multiple months (e.g., Oct-Dec) are set to the first month, and dates without a day are set to the first day of the month. Dates with a season are set as: winter = January, spring = April, summer = July and fall = October.\nFirst Author: Citations are sorted alphabetically by first author name. The secondary sort order within a group with the same first author is PMID.\nJournal: Citations are sorted alphabetically by journal name. The secondary sort order within a group with the same journal name is PMID.\n\nReverse sort order\n\nWhen sorting by Most Recent, Publication Date, First Author, or Journal, you can reverse the sort order by clicking the up/down arrow next to the selected sort option to toggle between ascending or descending order.\nThe reverse sort option will not display when Best Match sort order is selected.\n\nComputed author sort\nClicking an author name link on the abstract display runs a search for the author in PubMed. If an author name is computationally similar with an author name for additional PubMed citations, the results will display those citations first, in ranked order, followed by the non-similar citations. Author name disambiguation details are available in Liu W and Wilbur WJ.\nFinding the full text article\nPubMed records contain citation information (e.g., title, authors, journal, publication date) and abstracts of published articles and books. PubMed search results do not include the full text of the journal article, but the abstract view in PubMed includes links to the full text from other sources when available, such as the publisher\u2019s website or the PubMed Central (PMC) database. The full text journal site may require a fee or subscription, however online journals sometimes provide free access. Access may also be available through your organization, or local medical library.\nYou may be able to obtain free copies of full text articles in these ways:\nFree full text filter\nOn the filter sidebar, click \"Free full text\" to narrow results to resources that are available for free on the web, including PubMed Central, Bookshelf, and publishers' websites. Alternately, include free full text[Filter] in your query.\nPubMed Central\nWhen full text is available in PubMed Central (PMC), the \"Free in PMC\" icon will appear on the citation's abstract display under Full Text Links. Click the icon to view the article in PMC.\nPubMed Central (PMC) is the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature.\nFrom the publisher\nJournal publishers or related organizations may provide access to articles for free, for free after registering as an individual or guest, or for a fee. When provided by the publisher or other organization, icons linking to these sources can be found on the citation's abstract display under the \"Full Text Links\" and/or \"LinkOut\" sections. Icons will often indicate free full text when the article is available for free.\nNote: When you click a full text icon or link in PubMed, you leave PubMed and are directed to the full text at an external provider's site. NCBI does not hold the copyright to this material, and cannot give permission for its use. Users should review all copyright restrictions set forth by the full text provider before reproducing, redistributing, or making commercial use of material accessed through LinkOut.\nPlease see the Copyright and Disclaimers page for additional information.\nIf you are affiliated with a hospital, university, or other institution\nYour local medical library is your best option. If you see icons for your library on the abstract view this indicates that your library provides a link to the article, has the journal in its collection, or may otherwise obtain the article for you through interlibrary loan. If your library does not have access to the article you need, ask a librarian about ordering the article from another institution.\nLocal library\nSome local libraries have copies of medical journals or can get a copy of an article for you. Ask your local librarian about inter-library loan options and fees.\nFigures\nPubMed abstracts include figures when the full text article is available in PubMed Central (PMC). Click the thumbnail to view a larger version of the image, caption, and link to the figure and copyright information in PMC. Figures correspond to the article version archived in PMC, which in some cases may be the Author Manuscript version.\nSimilar articles\nThe abstract page for a citation includes links to PubMed citations for similar articles. The \"See all similar articles\" link will retrieve a pre-calculated set of PubMed citations that are closely related to the selected article:\n\nSimilar articles are displayed in ranked order from most to least relevant, with the \"linked from\" citation displayed first.\nSimilar articles are generated by comparing words from the title, abstract, and MeSH terms using a word-weighted algorithm.\nFilters are not activated for similar articles.\nYou can refine the list of similar articles using your search History, where the similar articles retrieval is represented as a list of PMIDs. Use this search number in a search. Refining the list removes the ranked order and may remove citations that are most relevant.\n\nSee Computation of similar articles for more information.\nCited by\nPubMed abstracts include links to other resources citing the current item. \"Cited by\" is generated using data submitted by publishers and from NCBI resources, when available. \"Cited by\" may not be a complete list of works citing a particular item.\nReferences\nPubMed abstracts include references when available. Reference lists are available for citations to full text articles included in the open access subset of PMC and for citations where the publisher supplied references in the citation data sent to PubMed.\nGrants and funding\nPubMed displays grant numbers, contract numbers, and intramural research identifiers that have been associated with a publication by:\n\nPublishers when depositing data in PubMed and PubMed Central;\nAn author, principal investigator, or project director when:\ndepositing a manuscript through the NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) or Europe PMC Plus system; or\nwhen adding a publication to My Bibliography; and/or\n\n\nNLM text mining and indexing processes.\n\nA grant award or contract may be acknowledged in an article and, therefore, displayed in PubMed, for various reasons, including support for activities that contributed directly to the publication as well as support for the generation of an underlying dataset or another shared resource. Additionally, some articles may not explicitly acknowledge intramural research support, yet the authors may be affiliated with a funding agency and may have associated their intramural support with a PubMed record at the time of manuscript deposit to PMC.\nFunding information in PubMed is collected in or converted to a standardized format when possible to enable broad discovery and impact monitoring. For example, if a publication acknowledges support from NIH grant number 1R01 GM987654-01-A1 or GM987654 or ROI GM987654 in a publication, in PubMed the funding information would be normalized to R01 GM987654, consistent with NIH requirements for proper grant number format. Funding associations made in a manuscript submission, grant reporting, or indexing system use standardized project identifiers provided to NLM by the organization administering the funding. To learn about searching funding information, see the search field section on Grants and funding [gr].\nThe scope of funding information included in PubMed has expanded over time to support the public access policies of NIH and other funding organizations. Since 1981, NLM has included grant or contract numbers or both that designate financial support by any agency of the United States Public Health Service (PHS), including NIH. Until 2000, only up to three grant numbers were included. Beginning in March 2006, funding information was expanded in PubMed to include grant, contract, and intramural funding assertions made in NIHMS and My Bibliography to support the NIH Public Access Policy. Publishers have been able to supply funding information directly to PubMed since January 2017.\nReporting funding information errors\nSome publications may be inadvertently linked to the wrong funding information. For example, the association of a publication to NIH-funded extramural research requires that the author(s) acknowledge NIH support in the article and that the acknowledgement be in a form that can be readily associated with a specific grant or contract. Variations in the format used to cite NIH funding may lead to either an inability to make an association or erroneous matches of publications to grants and contracts.\nIf you identify an error in funding information associated with a PubMed record, please contact the NLM help desk. NLM will not remove funding associations that reflect the acknowledged funding in the article without a published correction to ensure alignment with the scientific record. If an award association was provided by the author, principal investigator, or project director in My Bibliography or the NIHMS for formal NIH progress and public access compliance reporting, removing the association requires the principal investigator be notified and confirm the lack of direct support.\nNavigating searches with more than 10,000 results\nPubMed can display up to 10,000 results. The following options can help you navigate searches with more than 10,000 results:\n\nReverse the sort order to see the last results first.\nDivide the result set into smaller chunks using the results timeline or custom date range filter.\nAdjust your search to retrieve fewer results.\nFor programmatic use and bulk downloads, PubMed data is available via FTP.\n\nDiscovering related data in NCBI databases\nWhen available, links to other related NCBI databases are included on a citation's Abstract page under the Related information section. The complete list of database options is provided in Entrez Link Descriptions.\nMEDLINE indexed citations include additional supplemental information on the Abstract page such as MeSH terms, publication types, and substances with links to search for these data in PubMed and the MeSH Database.\nTo simultaneously search all NCBI databases, use the NCBI Search page.\nFind related resources using LinkOut\nMost PubMed records include LinkOut resources to a variety of websites including publishers, aggregators, libraries, biological databases, and sequence centers. LinkOut resources link to providers\u2019 sites to obtain the full text of articles or related information, e.g., consumer health. There may be a charge to access the text or information from a provider's site.\nTo view LinkOut resources, navigate to the LinkOut section at the end of an individual citation's abstract page.\nTo find citations with links to free full text articles, apply the \"Free full text\" filter to your search results.\nTo find citations with links to full text articles, enter search terms followed by AND full text[sb].\nMore information about Links:\n\nLinkOut resource categories such as \"free full text\" have been selected by the LinkOut provider.\nThe current list of LinkOut providers is available.\nA publisher's icon link may display on the abstract format if they have electronically provided their citation data to NCBI. Links are only available for publishers that are participating in LinkOut; publishers are responsible for providing working links.\n\nReporting broken or problem links\nLinkOut links are supplied by the LinkOut providers. Publishers who electronically supply their data to PubMed may include an icon that links to a site providing the full text. Corrections and changes to links are made by the providers and are their responsibility.\nTo report problem links or inquire about online journal subscriptions, contact the provider directly. Contact information is typically available at a provider's web site.\nCite, Save, and Share\n\nSave citations temporarily using the Clipboard\nSave citations indefinitely using My NCBI Collections\nSave citations as a text file\nCite an article\nExport citations into citation management software\nEmail citations\nCreate an email alert for a search\nCreate an RSS feed for a search\nPrint your search results\nGet a permalink to bookmark or share your search\nDownload PubMed data\n\nSave citations temporarily using the Clipboard\nThe Clipboard provides a place to collect up to 500 items from one or more searches.

The Show Index link will only display for fields that are compatible with this feature.\nEnter a term in the search box, then click Show Index.\nThe index displays an alphabetic list of search terms and the approximate number of citations for each term (the actual citation count is returned when the search is executed).\nScroll until you find a term you want to include in your search, and then highlight it to add it to the search box.\nMultiple terms may be selected from the list and added to the search box.\nAdd terms from the builder to the query box to construct your search.\nOnce you have finished adding terms to the query box, click Search (or Add to History) to run the search.\n\nMore information about using the index:\n\nPubMed processes all Boolean operators left to right.\nThe builder will automatically OR (and add parentheses) for multiple terms selected from the index.\nA slash will display after a space. For example, the MeSH Term and Subheading \"zika virus/analysis\" will display after \"zika virus infection/virology.\" Enter MeSH terms followed by a slash to go directly to the display for the MeSH/Subheading combination counts in the index.\nShow Index is not available for date fields.\n\nHistory\nYour PubMed search history appears on the Advanced Search page under History. This feature requires your web browser to accept cookies.\nDescriptions of each column in the History table appear below:\n\nSearch: Searches are numbered in chronological order.\nSearch numbers may be used in place of the search string itself when combining queries (e.g., #1 OR #2).\nA repeated query will move to the top of History but will retain its original numbering.\nHistory is limited to the last 100 searches. Once the maximum number is reached, PubMed will remove the oldest search from history and add the most current search.\n\n\nActions: Add, delete, or save a query. Adding queries from History places the search string into the Query box to be used in the next search. Deleting a query removes it from History.\nQuery: This column shows previous search strings as entered by the user.\nDetails: PubMed may modify or add search terms to a search to optimize retrieval, e.g., using automatic term mapping. Click the chevron icon \" > \" to expand search details and see how the search was translated.\nResults: The total number of citations retrieved for that query.

The MeSH database can be searched by MeSH term, MeSH Entry Term, Subheading, Publication Type, Supplementary Concept, or MeSH Scope Note.\nMore information about the MeSH database:\n\nAn autocomplete feature is available from the search box.\nSearch results are displayed in relevance-ranked order, therefore, when a user\u2019s search exactly matches a MeSH Term, that Term is displayed first.\nClick the MeSH term from the Summary display or choose Full from the display format menu to view additional information and search specifications, such as Subheadings, restrict to Major MeSH Topic, or exclude terms below the term in the MeSH hierarchy.\nYear Introduced is the year the term was added to MeSH. If more than one year is shown, the term was available for indexing back to the earliest year noted. Articles are indexed using the vocabulary in place at the time of indexing, therefore, the year introduced for a term and the date of publication of a citation indexed with that term may not agree.\n\nLaunch PubMed searches from the MeSH database\nTo build a PubMed search from MeSH:\n\nRun a search in the MeSH database.\nSelect terms using the check boxes.\nClick \"Add to search builder\" in the PubMed search builder portlet.\nYou may continue searching and including additional terms to the PubMed search builder using the \"Add to search builder\" and Boolean pull-down menu.\nWhen you are finished, click \"Search PubMed.\"\n\nSearch for journal information in the NLM Catalog\nThe NLM Catalog includes information about the journals in PubMed and the other NCBI databases.\nClick Journals in NCBI Databases on the homepage of NLM Catalog or the Journals link on the PubMed homepage to limit your NLM Catalog results to the subset of journals that are referenced in NCBI database records.\nSee the NLM Catalog help for additional information.\nOther journal resources include:\n\nPubMed journals with links to full text\nList of all journals included in PubMed via FTP\nList of Serials Indexed for Online Users\n\nUsing the E-utilities API tools\nE-utilities are tools that provide access to data outside of the regular NCBI web search interface.

Please see the terms and conditions for data users.\nCitation Matcher API\n\nAPI root\nFielded search\nHeuristic search\nAuto search\nRate control\n\nThe PubMed Citation Matcher API finds PubMed identifiers (PMIDs) for citation data in structured or raw form. The interface supports three retrieval methods:\n\nfield - runs a fielded search using core bibliographic information, such as journal, date, or volume.\nheuristic - collects all input elements into a single string and returns the closest matching documents.\nauto - combines the two above methods and switches to heuristic mode if the fielded search has not yielded a result. This is the default method.\n\nMore information about the Citation Matcher API:\n\nThe API supports both GET and POST requests.\nData is exchanged in JSON.\nInput data should be UTF-8 encoded.\nThe API returns a maximum of 20 PMIDs; queries returning more than 20 PMIDs are treated as bad requests.\n\nAPI root\nThe API root is:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/\nFielded search\nmethod=field runs a fielded search using core bibliographic information, such as journal, date, or volume. This functionality is similar to E-utilities ESearch; users should select the API that best suits their needs.\nFor a structured search, the following fields can be used:\n\njournal - the name of the journal\npdat - the publication date, in the format YYYY/MM/DD\nvolume - the volume of the publication\nissue - the volume of the publication\nauthors - one or more author names, in the format \"Surname Initial\" (Doe J). Optionally, the position may be specified as first, last, or auto.\n\nExample\nExample fielded search:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=field&journal=Front%20Immunol&volume=13&page=826091\nExample\nGET request URL:\n/citmatch/?method=field&journal=Front+Immunol&volume=13&page=826091&authors=Ihunwo+A\nPOST request data:\n{\n    \"citmatch\": {\n        \"method\": \"field\",\n        \"journal\": \"Front Immunol\",\n        \"volume\": \"13\",\n        \"page\": \"826091\",\n        \"authors\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Ihunwo AO\",\n                \"position\": \"first\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\nResponse:\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"operation\": \"citmatch\",\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"type\": \"uids\",\n        \"uids\": [\n            {\"pubmed\": \"35251006\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}                \nHeuristic search\nmethod=heuristic collects all input elements into a single string and returns the closest matching documents. It is sufficient to supply a raw citation string, such as: \"The role of drag in insect hovering. J. Exp. Biol. 2004;207:4147\u20134155.\"\nExample\nExample heuristic search:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=heuristic&raw-text=Neurogenesis%20and%20Viral%20Infection.%20Front%20Immunol.%202022%20Feb%2017;13:82609\nExample\nGET request URL:\n/citmatch/?method=heuristic&raw-text=Neurogenesis+and+Viral+Infection.+Front+Immunol.+2022+Feb+17;13:82609.\nPOST request data:\n{\n    \"citmatch\": {\n        \"method\": \"heuristic\",\n        \"raw-text\": {\"text\": \"Neurogenesis+and+Viral+Infection.+Front+Immunol.+2022+Feb+17;13:82609.\"}\n    }\n}\nResponse:\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"operation\": \"citmatch\",\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"type\": \"uids\",\n        \"uids\": [\n            {\"pubmed\": \"35251006\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}              \nAuto search\nmethod=auto first runs a fielded search, and if no results are found, it combines the fields and runs a heuristic search. This is the default method.\nFor a structured search, the following fields can be used:\n\njournal - the name of the journal\npdat - the publication date, in the format YYYY/MM/DD\nvolume - the volume of the publication\nissue - the volume of the publication\nauthors - one or more author names, in the format \"Surname Initial\" (Doe J). Optionally, the position may be specified as first, last, or auto.\n\nExample\nExample auto search:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=auto&journal=Front+Immunol&volume=13&page=826091&authors=Ranganathan+SFirst, a fielded search is run but no results are found due to the specified author not appearing on the citation:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=field&journal=Front+Immunol&volume=13&page=826091&authors=Ranganathan+SThen it concatenates the fields and runs a heuristic search, which returns the closest matching document(s):\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/citmatch/?method=heuristic&raw-text=Front+Immunol+13+826091+Ranganathan+S\nRate control\nWhen using the PubMed Citation Matcher API programmatically, we request that you limit your application's rate to 3 requests / sec and do not make concurrent requests to this service, even at off-peak times. Additionally, requests must contain the name of the calling project in the User-Agent HTTP header value; e.g. Hydra/1.3.15.\nBatch Citation Matcher\nUse the Batch Citation Matcher to retrieve PMIDs for multiple citations. The Batch Citation Matcher requires that you enter the bibliographic information (journal, volume, page, etc.) in a specific format.\nTo retrieve PubMed PMIDs:\n\nCreate citation strings for the items you would like to retrieve using the following format:\n    journal_title|year|volume|first_page|author_name|your_key|\n    Fields must be separated by a vertical bar with a final bar at the end of the string.\nEnter your email address. Email messages may take several minutes to process and be sent to your email address.\nUpload your citation strings as a text file (.txt) or enter each citation string on a separate line in the text box. If citation strings are entered in the text box and a file is uploaded, the results will be an aggregate of both.\nClick search.\n\nIf a match is not found the citation string will display one of the following:\n\nyour_key|NOT_FOUND;INVALID_JOURNAL - The journal name is not valid. See the journal lists or the NLM Catalog to find the correct journal abbreviation.\nNOT_FOUND - The journal name is valid, but the citation string did not find a match.\nAMBIGUOUS - The information provided matches more than one citation. Citation information with 3 or fewer matches include the PMIDs, and more than 3 matches include the total PMID match count. Use the Single Citation Matcher or ESearch to retrieve all citations for searched fields.\n\nNotes:\n\nText (.txt) format must be used when uploading a file.\nYou may receive multiple emails for searches containing more than 2,000 citation strings.\nEnter author names without punctuation as smith jc. Initials are optional.\nYour key is any string you choose to tag the citation, it is returned unaltered.\nThe journal title field may include the full journal title or the NLM title abbreviation.\nEach citation field is searched starting with the journal title until a unique match is found.\nThe journal title is a required field however you may omit other fields. If you omit fields you must retain the vertical bars in the citation string. For example, if you omit the volume number 88 from the first example below it should be entered as:\n    proc natl acad sci u s a|1991||3248|mann bj|P32022-1|\n\nExample input:\n\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1991|88|3248|mann bj|P32022-1|\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1992|89|3271|gould se|P26261-1|\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1970|89|3271|smith|P26261-1|\nres microbiol|1992|143|467|ivey dm|P25966-1|\nscience|1987|235|182|palmenberg ac|P12296-2|\neschatology|1993|12|22|public jq|C12233-2|\nvirology|1993|193|492|hardy me|Q02945-1|\nvirus genes|1992|6|393||P27423-1|\nyeast|1992|8|253|sasnauskas k|P24813-1|\n\nExample output:\n\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1991|88|3248|mann bj|P32022-1|2014248\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1992|89|3271|gould se|P26261-1|1565618\nproc natl acad sci u s a|1970|89|3271|smith|P26261-1|NOT_FOUND\nres microbiol|1992|143|467|ivey dm|P25966-1|1448623\nscience|1987|235|182|palmenberg ac|P12296-2|3026048\nC12233-2|NOT_FOUND;INVALID_JOURNAL\nvirology|1993|193|492|hardy me|Q02945-1|8382410\nvirus genes|1992|6|393||P27423-1|1335631\nyeast|1992|8|253|sasnauskas k|P24813-1|1514324\n\nConsumer health\nThe National Library of Medicine cannot provide specific medical advice.

If you want to report a translation that does not seem accurate for your search topic, please e-mail the information to the NLM Help Desk.\n1. Subject translation table\nThe Subject Translation Table contains:\n\nBritish and American spellings\nPairs: singular and plural word forms, synonyms, and other closely related terms\nDrug brand name to generic name translations\nMeSH terms\nThe See-Reference mappings (also known as entry terms) for MeSH terms\nMeSH Subheadings\nPublication Types\nPharmacologic action terms\nTerms derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) that have equivalent synonyms or lexical variants in English\nSupplementary concept (substance) names and their synonyms.\n\nIf a match is found in this translation table, the term will be searched as MeSH (that includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy), and in all fields.\nFor example, if you enter child rearing in the search box, PubMed will translate this search to: \"child rearing\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"child\"[All Fields] AND \"rearing\"[All Fields]) OR \"child rearing\"[All Fields]\nIf you enter a MeSH Term that is also a Pharmacologic Action PubMed will search the term as [MeSH Terms], [Pharmacologic Action], and [All Fields].\nIf you enter an entry term for a MeSH term the translation will also include an all fields search for the MeSH term associated with the entry term. For example, a search for odontalgia will translate to: \"toothache\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"toothache\"[All Fields] OR \"odontalgia\"[All Fields] OR \"odontalgias\"[All Fields] because Odontalgia is an entry term for the MeSH term toothache.\nSubstance name mappings do not include a mapping for individual terms in a phrase, e.g., IL-22 will not include IL[All Fields] AND 22[All Fields].\nMeSH term mappings that include a standalone number or single character do not include a mapping for individual terms in a phrase, e.g., Protein C will not include Protein[All Fields] or C[All Fields].\n2. Journals translation table\nThe Journals translation table contains the:\n\nfull journal title\ntitle abbreviation\nISSN and eISSN number.\n\nThese will automatically map to the journal abbreviation that is used to search journals in PubMed and in all fields. For example, a search for endocrine pathology will translate to: \"Endocr Pathol\"[Journal] OR (\"endocrine\"[All Fields] AND \"pathology\"[All Fields]) OR \"endocrine pathology\"[All Fields]\n3. Author index\nIf the term is not found in the above tables, and is not a single term, PubMed checks the author index for a match. The author index includes author names and initials, as well as full author names for articles published from 2002 forward, if available.\nMore information about author searching:\n\nPubMed automatically truncates a search for an author's name to account for varying initials, e.g., o'brien j retrieves o'brien ja, o'brien jb, o'brien jc jr, as well as o'brien j.\nWhen combining multiple authors, to avoid a match with full author names, include initials or use the [au] search tag, e.g., ryan[au] james[au]. Author names comprised of only stopwords, e.g., as a, are not searched as authors if they are part of phrase, chemical burn as a danger, unless the search only includes the author name, e.g., as a.\nEnter a full author name in natural or inverted order, e.g., julia s wong or wong julia s.\nA comma following the last name for searching is optional. For some names, however, it is necessary to distinguish which name is the last name by using the comma following the last name, e.g., james, ryan.\nOmit periods after initials and put all suffixes at the end, e.g., vollmer charles jr\nInitials and suffixes are not required, if you include a middle initial or suffix, you will only retrieve citations for articles that were published using the middle initial or suffix.\nTo distinguish author initials that may match a full author name use the [fau] search tag, e.g., peterson do[fau].\n\n4. Investigator (Collaborator) index\nIf the term is not found in the above tables, except for Author, and is not a single term, the investigator index is consulted for a match. The investigator (collaborator) index includes full names, if available. Enter a full investigator name in natural or inverted order, e.g., harry janes or janes harry.\n5. If no match is found?\nPubMed breaks apart the phrase and repeats the above automatic term mapping process until a match is found. PubMed ignores stopwords in searches.\nIf there is no match, the individual terms will be combined (ANDed) together and searched in all fields.\nWhen a search includes terms that were tagged with a search field during the automatic term mapping process and retrieves zero results, the system triggers a subsequent search using \"Schema: all .\" \"Schema: all\" modifies the search by removing the automatically added search field tags, and then searches each term in all fields.\nAlgorithm for finding best matching citations in PubMed\nThe learned ranking algorithm combines over 150 signals that are helpful for finding best matching results. Most of these signals are computed from the query-document term pairs (e.g., number of term matches between the query and the document) while others are either specific to a document (e.g., publication type; publication year) or query (e.g., query length). The new ranking model was built on relevance data extracted from the anonymous and aggregated PubMed search logs over an extended period of time.\nFor more information about the Best Match algorithm, please see:\n\nTechnical details in the paper Best Match: New relevance search for PubMed by Fiorini N, Canese K, Starchenko G, et al. in PLoS Biol (2018).\nNLM Technical Bulletin article: Updated Algorithm for the PubMed Best Match Sort Order\n\nPubMed coverage\nThe PubMed database contains citations and abstracts to biomedical literature, facilitating searching across several NLM literature resources:\n\nMEDLINE\nPubMed Central (PMC)\nNCBI Bookshelf\n\nFor additional information, please see the NLM Fact Sheet: Medline, PubMed, and PMC (PubMed Central): How are they different?\nPubMed includes citations to original research articles, literature reviews, case reports, letters, editorials, commentaries, and other selected publications on scientific and medical topics (see: publication types found in PubMed). Some categories of content are out of scope for PubMed, such as: book reviews, individual conference abstracts, obituaries and in memoriam articles, news and announcements, and brief summaries of research articles. More examples are included in XML Help for PubMed Data Providers: What types of articles are accepted?.\nMEDLINE\nMEDLINE contains citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine. The MEDLINE database contains citations from the late 1940s to the present, with some older material.\nNew citations from MEDLINE journals are received electronically from publishers and appear in PubMed daily. Most citations progress to in-process, and then to indexed for MEDLINE; however, not all citations will be indexed for MEDLINE. PubMed includes some citations from MEDLINE journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE, such as:\n\nCitations preceding the date that a journal was selected for MEDLINE indexing.\nOut-of-scope citations (e.g., articles on plate tectonics or astrophysics) from certain MEDLINE journals, primarily general science and chemistry journals, for which the life sciences articles are indexed for MEDLINE.\n\nCitations that have been indexed for MEDLINE and updated with NLM Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), publication types, GenBank accession numbers, and other indexing data are available daily. To limit your search to MEDLINE citations, add medline[sb] to your search.\nIndexing method\nThe method used to assign Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) has changed over time. For more information, please see Incorporating Values for Indexing Method in MEDLINE/PubMed XML. Use the following searches to find citations indexed with each method:\n\nAutomated - MeSH indexing is provided algorithmically. Search: indexingmethod_automated\nCurated - MeSH indexing is provided algorithmically and a human reviewed (and possibly modified) the algorithm results. Search: indexingmethod_curated\nManual \u2013 MeSH indexing is provided by humans with no algorithmic suggestions. Search: indexingmethod_manual\n\nPubMed Central (PMC)\nPubMed Central (PMC) is a full text archive that includes articles from journals reviewed and selected by NLM for archiving (current and historical), as well as individual articles and preprints collected for archiving in compliance with funder policies. Some PMC content is not cited in PubMed, such as book reviews and conference abstracts (see: PubMed coverage).\nPreprints\nAs of June 2020, PubMed Central (PMC) includes preprints that report NIH-funded research results. Citations to these preprints are deposited in PubMed. To learn more, see: NIH Preprint Pilot.\nExample\nTo search for preprints in PubMed, include preprint[filter] in your query.\ncovid-19 AND preprint[pt]\nExample\nTo exclude preprints from your search results in PubMed, use the Boolean operator NOT.\ncovid-19 NOT preprint[pt]\nNCBI Bookshelf\nBookshelf is a full text archive of books, reports, databases, and other documents related to biomedical, health, and life sciences. PubMed includes citations for books and some individual chapters available on Bookshelf.\nPubMed format\nThe PubMed Format tags table defines the data tags that compose the PubMed format. The tags are presented in alphabetical order. Some of the tags (e.g., CIN) are not mandatory and therefore will not be found in every record. Other tags (e.g., AU, MH, and RN) may occur multiple times in one record. You can download records in PubMed format as a text file (.txt) or as an .nbib file for exporting into citation management software programs.\nNot all fields are searchable in PubMed.

If a field is searchable, the search tag appears after the field name in square brackets: Affiliation [ad]. A small number of searchable fields do not correspond to a specific field in the PubMed format.\n\nSee Search field tags for a list of searchable fields.\nSee PubMed format for a quick table view of the fields found in PubMed records.\n\nAffiliation [ad]\nAffiliation may be included for authors, corporate authors and investigators, e.g., cleveland [ad] AND clinic [ad], if submitted by the publisher.\nMultiple affiliations were added to citations starting from 2014, previously only the first author\u2019s affiliation was included. PubMed includes the note \"Contributed equally\" in the affiliation field when this information is supplied by publishers.\nSearching for terms in the affiliation field searches in all author affiliations on a citation. For example, a search for Hopkins[ad] AND Bloomberg[ad] can find these terms spread across multiple authors\u2019 affiliations on the same citation.\nTo search for multiple terms appearing within the same affiliation, use a proximity search. You can also search affiliations using a phrase search; however, we suggest using a proximity search for more comprehensive results because affiliation data may be provided in a variety of ways for the same institution.\nExample\nUse proximity searching to find citations with authors from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:\n\"Hopkins Bloomberg Public\"[ad:~45]This search will find any citation where the words \"Hopkins,\" \"Bloomberg,\" and \"Public\" appear in the same affiliation, with no more than forty-five words between each term. Search results may include:\n\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nJohns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health\nBloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University\nBloomberg Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health\n...and more!\n\nAll Fields [all]\nUntagged terms and terms tagged with [all] are processed using Automatic Term Mapping (ATM). Terms that do not map are searched in all search fields except for Place of Publication, Create Date, Completion Date, Entry Date, MeSH Date, and Modification Date. Terms enclosed in double quotes or including wildcards (*) will be searched in all fields and not processed using automatic term mapping. PubMed ignores stopwords.\nArticle Identifier [aid]\nIncludes article identifiers submitted by journal publishers such as DOI (digital object identifier).\nAuthor\u00a0[au]\nThe format to search for this field is: last name followed by a space and up to the first two initials followed by a space and a suffix abbreviation, if applicable, all without periods or a comma after the last name (e.g., fauci as or o'brien jc jr). Initials and suffixes may be omitted when searching.\nPubMed automatically truncates a search for an author's name to account for varying initials, e.g., o'brien j [au] will retrieve o'brien ja, o'brien jb, o'brien jc jr, as well as o'brien j. To turn off automatic truncation, enclose the author's name in double quotes and tag with [au] in brackets, e.g., \"o'brien j\" [au] to retrieve just o'brien j.\nSearching by full author name for articles published from 2002 forward is also possible, if available. See NLM policy on author names.\nAuthor Identifier [auid]\nThe author identifier includes a unique identifier associated with an author, corporate or investigator name, if supplied by a publisher. The field includes the organization authority that established the unique identifier, such as, ORCID, ISNI, VIAF, e.g., orcid 0000-0001-5027-4446 [auid].\nBook [book]\nThe book search field includes book citations, e.g., genereviews [book].\nUse the following untagged searches to retrieve all book or book chapters, e.g., ataxia AND pmcbookchapter\n\nbooks and chapters: pmcbook\nbooks: pmcbooktitle\nbook chapters: pmcbookchapter\n\nThe above searches capture book records provided by the NCBI Bookshelf database; they exclude a small number of documents from other providers that appear in both PubMed and Bookshelf. For the most comprehensive search of records appearing in both PubMed and Bookshelf, search \"pubmed books\"[sb].\nComment Correction Type\nThe data in these fields are citations to other associated journal publications, e.g., comments or errata. Often these link to the respective citation. Comments/Corrections data can be retrieved by the search term that follows each type:\n\nComment in: hascommentin\nComment on: hascommenton\nCorrected and republished in: hascorrectedrepublishedin\nCorrected and republished from: hascorrectedrepublishedfrom\nDataset use reported in: hasassociatedpublication\nDataset described in: hasassociateddataset\nErratum in: haserratumin\nErratum for: haserratumfor\nExpression of concern in: hasexpressionofconcernin\nExpression of concern for: hasexpressionofconcernfor\nOriginal Report in: hasoriginalreportin\nRepublished in: hasrepublishedin\nRepublished from: hasrepublishedfrom\nRetracted and republished in: hasretractedandrepublishedin\nRetracted and republished from: hasretractedandrepublishedfrom\nRetraction in: hasretractionin\nRetraction of: hasretractionof\nSummary for patients in: hassummaryforpatientsin\nUpdate in: hasupdatein\nUpdate of: hasupdateof\n\nCompletion Date [dcom]\nUsed by NLM for internal processing. Completon Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [dcom] search tag is required.\nConflict of Interest Statement [cois]\nThe conflict of interest statement from the published article. Conflict of interest statements are available when supplied by the publisher in the citation data sent to PubMed, or when included in full text articles in PubMed Central (PMC).\nTo retrieve all citations that contain conflict of interest statements, use the query hascois.\nCorporate Author [cn]\nCorporate author identifies the corporate or collective authorship of an article. Corporate names display exactly as they appear in the journal.\nNote: Citations indexed pre-2000 and some citations indexed in 2000-2001 retain corporate authors at the end of the title field. For comprehensive searches, consider including terms and/or words searched in the title field [ti].\nCreate Date [crdt]\nThe date the citation record was first created in PubMed. Create Date can be helpful when checking PubMed for citations added since the last time a query was run. Create Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [crdt] search tag is required.\nEC/RN Number [rn]\nEC/RN numbers are assigned by:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Substance Registration System for Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNIIs), e.g., Y92OUS2H9B\nThe Enzyme Commission (EC) to designate a particular enzyme, e.g., EC 1.1.1.57\nThe Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for Registry Numbers, e.g., 2751-14-6\n\nThe EC/RN number search field includes both the Registry Number and the Related Registry Number (available in the NLM MeSH Browser).\nEditor [ed]\nThe editor search field includes the editors for book or chapter citations.\nEntry Date [edat]\nEntry date (EDAT) is used for PubMed processing, such as \u201cMost Recent\u201d sort order (i.e., last in, first out).\nEDAT is typically set within 24 hours of the citation\u2019s availability in PubMed. Exceptions: As of December 15, 2008, citations added to PubMed more than twelve months after the date of publication have the EDAT set to the date of publication, except for book citations. Prior to this, the Entry Date was set to the Publication Date on citations published before September 1997. Entry Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [edat] search tag is required.\nNote: Entry Date was called Entrez Date in the legacy PubMed system (retired in 2020).\nFilter [filter]\u00a0[sb]\nTechnical tags used by LinkOut, filters include:\n\nloall[sb] - citations with LinkOut links in PubMed\nfree full text[sb] - citations that include a link to a free full text article\nfull text[sb] - citations that include a link to a full text article\n\nFirst Author Name [1au]\nThe first personal author name in a citation.\nFull Author Name [fau]\nThe full author name for articles published from 2002 forward, if available. Full author searches can be entered in natural or inverted order, e.g., julia s wong or wong julia s.\nFull Investigator Name [fir]\nThe index for the article's full investigator or collaborator name, if available. Full investigator searches can be entered in natural or inverted order, e.g., harry janes or janes harry.\nGrants and Funding [gr]\nThe Grants and funding [gr] search field (previously Grant Number) includes grant numbers, contract numbers, or other intramural research identifiers associated with a publication.\nThe most common type of funding information associated with a publication in PubMed are grant numbers. Data in the Grants and funding search field can consist of up to four parts:\n\nNumber contains the grant, contract, intramural project number (or both) that designates financial support by any agency of the United States Public Health Service (US PHS), any institute of the National Institutes of Health, or other organization.\nFunder code contains the 2-letter grant code or funding organization acronym, for example: CA for National Cancer Institute or DDCF for Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. See Grant Number Information Found in the GR Field in MEDLINE/PubMed (Archived) for the 2-character abbreviations, PHS agency acronyms, and other US and non-US funding organizations.\nAgency includes the acronym or mnemonic in the case of US PHS agencies, or full organization name. As of 2009 this includes the agency's hierarchical structure from lower to higher entity, when known. For example, NCI NIH HHS for National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nCountry contains the home country of the funding agency, for example: United States.\n\nEach individual part can be searched using [gr], for example: CA101211[gr], CA[gr], NCI[gr], NIH[gr], or United States[gr].\nThis field can also be searched to find articles with intramural support; e.g., \"intramural nih\"[gr] finds all journal citations authored by intramural NIH staff.\nCompleteness of funding information in PubMed will vary by source.\nSee Grants and funding for more information about data in this field.\nInvestigator [ir]\nNames of principal investigator(s) or collaborators who contributed to the research. Search names following the author field format, for example: soller b[ir].\nISBN [isbn]\nThe ISBN for book or book chapters.\nIssue [ip]\nThe number of the journal issue in which the article was published.\nJournal [ta]\nThe journal search field includes the journal title abbreviation, full journal title, or ISSN/eISSN number (e.g., J Biol Chem, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 0021-9258). If a journal title contains special characters, e.g., parentheses, brackets, enter the name without these characters, e.g., enter J Hand Surg [Am] as J Hand Surg Am.\nLanguage [la]\nThe language search field includes the language in which the article was published. Note that many non-English articles have English language abstracts. You may search using either the language or the first three characters of most languages, e.g., chi [la] retrieves the same results as chinese [la]. The most notable exception is jpn [la] for Japanese.\nLast Author Name [lastau]\nThe last personal author name in a citation.\nLocation ID [lid]\nLocation ID includes the DOI or publisher ID that serves the role of pagination to locate an online article.\nMeSH Date\u00a0[mhda]\nThe date the citation was indexed with MeSH Terms and elevated to MEDLINE for citations with an Entry Date after March 4, 2000. The MeSH Date is initially set to the Entry Date when the citation is added to PubMed. MeSH Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [mhda] search tag is required.\nDates must be entered using the format YYYY/MM/DD [mhda], e.g., 2000/03/15 [mhda]. The month and day are optional (e.g., 2000 [mhda] or 2000/03 [mhda]).\nTo enter a date range, insert a colon (:) between each date, e.g., 1999:2000 [mhda] or 2000/03:2000/04 [mhda].\nMeSH Major Topic [majr]\nA MeSH term that is one of the main topics discussed in the article denoted by an asterisk on the MeSH term or MeSH/Subheading combination, e.g., Cytokines/physiology* See MeSH Terms [mh] below.\nMeSH Subheadings [sh]\nMeSH Subheadings are used with MeSH terms to help describe more completely a particular aspect of a subject. For example, the drug therapy of asthma is displayed as asthma/drug therapy; see MeSH/Subheading Combinations in MeSH Terms [mh] below.\nThe MeSH Subheading field allows users to \"free float\" Subheadings, e.g., hypertension [mh] AND toxicity [sh].\nMeSH Subheadings automatically include the more specific Subheading terms under the term in a search. To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [sh:noexp], e.g., therapy [sh:noexp].\nIn addition, you can enter the two-letter MeSH Subheading abbreviations rather than spelling out the Subheading, e.g., dh [sh] = diet therapy [sh].\nMeSH Terms\u00a0[mh]\nThe NLM Medical Subject Headings controlled vocabulary of biomedical terms that is used to describe the subject of each journal article in MEDLINE. MeSH is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. MeSH terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. PubMed allows you to view this hierarchy and select terms for searching in the MeSH Database.\nMEDLINE articles are automatically indexed with MeSH terms using a well-refined algorithm. Applying the MeSH vocabulary ensures that articles are uniformly indexed by subject, whatever the author's words. For more information, see Frequently Asked Questions about Indexing for MEDLINE.\nMore information about MeSH Terms and Major MeSH Topic search fields:\n\nTo search the term only as a MeSH term, it must be tagged using the search field, e.g., [mh] for MeSH Terms or [majr] for MeSH Major Topic. A tagged term is checked against the subject translation table, and then mapped to the appropriate MeSH term(s). To turn off mapping to multiple MeSH terms, enter the tagged MeSH term in double quotes.\nMeSH terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. MeSH terms in PubMed automatically include the more specific MeSH terms in a search. To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [mh:noexp], e.g., neoplasms [mh:noexp].For more detailed information about MeSH vocabulary including the hierarchical structure, please see the MeSH homepage.\nMeSH/Subheading Combinations: To directly attach MeSH Subheadings, use the format MeSH Term/Subheading, e.g., neoplasms/diet therapy. You may also use the two-letter MeSH Subheading abbreviations, e.g., neoplasms/dh. The [mh] tag is not required, however [majr] may be used, e.g., plants/genetics[majr]. Only one Subheading may be directly attached to a MeSH term. For a MeSH/Subheading combination, PubMed always includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms for the MeSH term and also includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader Subheadings. The broader Subheading, or one of its indentions, will be directly attached to the MeSH term or one of its indentions. For example, hypertension/therapy also retrieves hypertension/diet therapy; hypertension/drug therapy; hypertension, malignant/therapy; hypertension, malignant/drug therapy, and so on, as well as hypertension/therapy.\nTo turn off the automatic inclusion of the more specific terms, use the syntax [field:noexp], e.g., hypertension [mh:noexp], or hypertension [majr:noexp], or hypertension/therapy [mh:noexp]. The latter example turns off the more specific terms in both parts, searching for only the one Subheading therapy attached directly to only the one MeSH term hypertension.\nIf parentheses are embedded in a MeSH term, replace the parentheses with a space and tag with [mh] e.g., enter the MeSH term Benzo(a)pyrene as benzo a pyrene [mh].\nMeSH terms can be selected for searching in the MeSH database and from the advanced search builder index.\n\nModification Date [lr]\nModification date is a completed citation\u2019s most recent revision date. Modification Date is not included in All Fields retrieval; the [lr] search tag is required.\nNLM Unique ID [jid]\nThe NLM ID is the alpha-numeric identifier for the cited journal that was assigned by the NLM Integrated Library System LocatorPlus, e.g., 0375267 [jid].\nOther Term [ot]\nThe author keyword field (OT field) is searchable with the title/abstract [tiab], text word [tw] and other term [ot] search tags. To retrieve all citations that have keywords, use the query haskeyword. Other term data may display an asterisk to indicate a major concept; however, you cannot search other terms with a major concept tag.\nOwner\nThe owner search field includes the acronym that identifies the organization that supplied the citation data. Search using owner + the owner acronym, e.g., ownernasa.\nPagination [pg]\nEnter only the first page number that the article appears on. The citation will display the full pagination of the article but this field is searchable using only the first page number.\nPersonal Name as Subject [ps]\nUse this search field tag to limit retrieval to where the name is the subject of the article, e.g., varmus h[ps]. Search for personal names as subject using the author field format, e.g., varmus h[ps].\nPharmacological Action [pa]\nSubstances known to have a particular pharmacologic action. Each pharmacologic action term index is created with the drug/substance terms known to have that effect. This includes both MeSH terms and terms for Supplementary Concept Records.\nPlace of Publication [pl]\nIndicates the cited journal's country of publication. Geographic place of publication regions are not searchable. In order to retrieve records for all countries in a region (e.g., North America) it is necessary to OR together the countries of interest. Note: This field is not included in all fields or text word retrieval.\nPMCID and MID\nSearch for PMC or NIH manuscript identifiers using the appropriate prefix followed by the ID number, e.g., PMC2600426. To retrieve all NIH manuscript citations, use the query hasnihmsid.\nPMID [pmid]\nTo search for a PubMed Identifier (PMID), enter the ID with or without the search field tag [pmid]. You can search for several PMIDs by entering each number in the search box separated by a space (e.g., 17170002 16381840); PubMed will OR the PMIDs together.\nPMIDs do not change over time or during processing and are never reused.\nPublication Date [dp]\nPublication date is the date that the article was published. The search field tags [dp] and [pdat] may be used interchangeably for publication date searching.\nDates or date ranges must be searched using the format yyyy/mm/dd [dp], e.g., 1998/03/06 [dp]. The month and day are optional (e.g., 1998 [dp] or 1998/03 [dp]).\nTo enter a date range search, insert a colon (:) between each date, e.g., 1996:1998 [dp] or 1998/01:1998/04 [dp].\nUse the following format to search X days, months or years immediately preceding today\u2019s date where X = numeric value:\n\n\"last X days\"[dp]\n\"last X months\"[dp]\n\"last X year\"[dp]\n\nMore information about publication dates:\n\nThe time between an article\u2019s publication and the citation\u2019s availability in PubMed varies depending on when the publisher deposits the citation to PubMed. Because of this, searching with Create Date [crdt] (the date a citation was created in PubMed) is often more comprehensive than Publication Date [dp] when checking PubMed on a regular basis for new citations.\nJournals vary in the way the publication date appears on an issue. Some journals include just the year, whereas others include the year plus month or year plus month plus day. And, some journals use the year and season (e.g., Winter 1997). The publication date in the citation is recorded as it appears in the journal.\nPublication dates without a month are set to January, multiple months (e.g., Oct-Dec) are set to the first month, and dates without a day are set to the first day of the month. Dates with a season are set as: winter = January, spring = April, summer = July and fall = October.\nIf an article is published electronically and in print on different dates both dates are searchable and may be included on the citation prefaced with an Epub or Print label. The electronic date will not be searchable if it is later than the print date, except when range searching.\nTo search for electronic dates only use the search tag [EPDAT], for print dates only tag with [PPDAT].\nMost journals now publish articles online on a continuous basis, as soon as they are ready for publication (after peer review and editing, etc.) instead of, or in addition to, publishing collections of articles as an \"issue\" on a periodic basis. When a journal deposits a citation for an \"online first\" article in PubMed, NLM appends the note \"[Online ahead of print]\" to the online publication date. The citation is updated, and the ahead of print notation removed, when the article is included in a journal issue. The lag between the \"online first\" and \"issue\" publication dates may be days, weeks, months, or more than a year. In many cases, depending on the journal, the online first version is considered to be the version of record. The \"[Online ahead of print]\" note in PubMed should not be taken to mean that the cited article is not the version of record.\nBookshelf citation publication dates are generated from the book\u2019s original publication date. Publication date searches include Contribution Date (CTDT) and Date Revised (DRDT) in addition to Publication Date (DP) for Book citations.\n\nPublication Type [pt]\nDescribes the material presented in the article (e.g., Review, Clinical Trial, Retracted Publication, Letter). Citations may include multiple Publication Types. Use the search tag [pt] with any PubMed Publication Type, e.g., review[pt].\nPublication Types are arranged hierarchically with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms, and publication types automatically include the more specific publication types in a search. To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [pt:noexp], e.g., review [pt:noexp].\nPublisher [pubn]\nIncludes publisher names for Bookshelf citations.\nSecondary Source ID [si]\nThe SI field identifies secondary source databanks and accession numbers, e.g., GenBank, GEO, PubChem, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN. The field is composed of the source followed by a slash followed by an accession number and can be searched with one or both components, e.g., genbank [si], AF001892 [si], genbank/AF001892 [si]. To retrieve all citations with an SI value, search hasdatabanklist.\nSubset [sb]\nThe subset field is a method of restricting retrieval by subject, citation status and journal category, with the search tag [SB]. See also filters and Find related resources using LinkOut.\nSupplementary Concept [nm]\nIncludes chemical, protocol, disease or organism terms. Synonyms to the supplementary concepts will automatically map when tagged with [nm]. This field was implemented in mid-1980; however, many chemical names are searchable as MeSH terms before that date.\nText Words [tw]\nIncludes all words and numbers in the title, abstract, other abstract, MeSH terms, MeSH Subheadings, Publication Types, Substance Names, Personal Name as Subject, Corporate Author, Secondary Source, Comment/Correction Notes, and Other Terms (see Other Term [OT] above) typically non-MeSH subject terms (keywords), including NASA Space Flight Mission, assigned by an organization other than NLM.\nTitle [ti]\nWords and numbers included in the title of a citation, as well as the collection title for book citations.\nTitle/Abstract [tiab]\nWords and numbers included in a citation's title, collection title, abstract, other abstract and author keywords (Other Term [ot] field). English language abstracts are taken directly from the published article. If an article does not have a published abstract, NLM does not create one.\nTransliterated Title [tt]\nWords and numbers in title originally published in a non-English language, in that language. Non-Roman alphabet language titles are transliterated. Transliterated title is not included in Text Word [TW] retrieval.\nVolume [vi]\nThe number of the journal volume in which an article is published.\nNLM author indexing policy\nNLM author indexing policy is as follows:\n\n1966 - 1984: MEDLINE did not limit the number of authors.\n1984 - 1995: The NLM limited the number of authors to 10, with \"et al\" as the eleventh occurrence.\n1996 - 1999: The NLM increased the limit from 10 to 25. If there were more than 25 authors, the first 24 were listed, the last author was used as the 25th, and the twenty-sixth and beyond became \"et al.\"\n2000 - Present: MEDLINE does not limit the number of authors.\n\nMore information:\n\nBeginning in mid-2005, the policy restrictions on number of author names in past years were lifted so that on an individual basis, a citation may be edited to include all author names in the published article, regardless of the limitation in effect when the citation was created.\nEffective with 1992 date of publication, letters are indexed individually with authors rather than as an anonymous group.\nUntil 1990, NLM transliterated up to five authors' Cyrillic or Japanese names to the Roman alphabet.\nBetween 1990 and 2016, the first ten Cyrillic or Japanese names are transliterated. Chinese ideograms were not transliterated by NLM, but if transliterations of the authors names are available in the journal article or table of contents, they were included in the citation, even if that includes only one author in a multi-author article.\nBeginning in 2016, author names are published in Roman characters in all MEDLINE journals, and NLM no longer transliterates Cyrillic or Japanese names. All author names are included as published.\n\nError messages\nSystem error messages\nPlease provide your IT staff with the technical browser advice for NCBI web pages to ensure your browser, firewall, and servers are enabled for JavaScript, cookies, pop-ups, and HTTP 1.1.

The similarity between documents is measured by the words they have in common, with some adjustment for document lengths. To carry out such a program, one must first define what a word is. For us, a word is basically an unbroken string of letters and numerals with at least one letter of the alphabet in it. Words end at hyphens, spaces, new lines, and punctuation. The 132 common, but uninformative, words (also known as stopwords) are eliminated from processing at this stage. Next, a limited amount of stemming of words is done, but no thesaurus is used in processing. Words from the abstract of a document are classified as text words. Words from titles are also classified as text words, but words from titles are added in a second time to give them a small advantage in the local weighting scheme. MeSH terms are placed in a third category, and a MeSH term with a subheading qualifier is entered twice, once without the qualifier and once with it. If a MeSH term is starred (indicating a major concept in a document), the star is ignored. These three categories of words (or phrases in the case of MeSH) comprise the representation of a document. No other fields, such as Author or Journal, enter into the calculations.\nHaving obtained the set of terms that represent each document, the next step is to recognize that not all words are of equal value. Each time a word is used, it is assigned a numerical weight. This numerical weight is based on information that the computer can obtain by automatic processing. Automatic processing is important because the number of different terms that have to be assigned weights is close to two million for this system. The weight or value of a term is dependent on three types of information: 1) the number of different documents in the database that contain the term; 2) the number of times the term occurs in a particular document; and 3) the number of term occurrences in the document. The first of these pieces of information is used to produce a number called the global weight of the term. The global weight is used in weighting the term throughout the database. The second and third pieces of information pertain only to a particular document and are used to produce a number called the local weight of the term in that specific document. When a word occurs in two documents, its weight is computed as the product of the global weight times the two local weights (one pertaining to each of the documents).\nThe global weight of a term is greater for the less frequent terms. This is reasonable because the presence of a term that occurred in most of the documents would really tell one very little about a document. On the other hand, a term that occurred in only 100 documents of one million would be very helpful in limiting the set of documents of interest. A word that occurred in only 10 documents is likely to be even more informative and will receive an even higher weight.\nThe local weight of a term is the measure of its importance in a particular document. Generally, the more frequent a term is within a document, the more important it is in representing the content of that document. However, this relationship is saturating, i.e., as the frequency continues to go up, the importance of the word increases less rapidly and finally comes to a finite limit. In addition, we do not want a longer document to be considered more important just because it is longer; therefore, a length correction is applied. This local weight computation is based on the Poisson distribution and the formula can be found in Lin J and Wilbur WJ.\nThe similarity between two documents is computed by adding up the weights (local wt1 \u00d7 local wt2 \u00d7 global wt) of all of the terms the two documents have in common. This provides an indication of how related two documents are. The resultant score is an example of a vector score. Vector scoring was originated by Gerard Salton and has a long history in text retrieval. The interested reader is referred to Salton, Automatic Text Processing, Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1989 for further information on this topic. Our approach differs from other approaches in the way we calculate the local weights for the individual terms. Once the similarity score of a document in relation to each of the other documents in the database has been computed, that document's neighbors are identified as the most similar (highest scoring) documents found. These closely related documents are pre-computed for each document in PubMed so that when you select Similar articles, the system has only to retrieve this list. This enables a fast response time for such queries.\nJournal lists\nPubMed journals\n\nUncompressed\nGNU zip\nUNIX Compress\nPKZIP\n\nPubMed and NCBI molecular biology database journals\n\nUncompressed\nGNU zip\nUNIX Compress\nPKZIP\n\nBack to Top\nNCBI Literature Resources\nMeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Causes range from acute digestive issues like acid reflux to chronic conditions such as esophagitis.\nEpigastric pain is a term to describe discomfort or aching that occurs beneath your rib cage in your upper abdominal region.\nIt has many causes, including overeating, lactose intolerance, and underlying conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammation, and infection.\nKnowing what\u2019s causing your epigastric pain is important so you can work with a doctor to treat it.\nKeep reading to learn more about what may be causing your symptoms.\nWhat causes epigastric pain?\n\nPotential causes of epigastric pain include:\n1. Acid reflux and heartburn\nAcid reflux is when some of the acid or food in your stomach washes back up into your esophagus. If you experience frequent acid reflux, you may have a condition known as GERD.\nHeartburn is a symptom of acid reflux and GERD, commonly described as a burning feeling in your chest after you eat. This feeling is usually worse when you lie or bend down due to the position of your esophagus.\n2. Lactose intolerance\nLactose intolerance happens when your body has trouble digesting dairy products, such as milk or cheese. Typically, symptoms will occur every time you eat dairy.\nDairy products contain a type of sugar called lactose. Lactose intolerance often develops when you don\u2019t have enough lactase enzyme. This enzyme is important in breaking down lactose. Learn more about the symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nAlthough lactose intolerance may cause epigastric pain, it\u2019s usually felt lower down in the abdominal area.\n3. Overeating\nWhen you eat too much in one go, your stomach can expand beyond its usual size. This puts a lot of pressure on the organs around it. This pressure can cause pain in your gut and lead to indigestion (dyspepsia).\nSymptoms may include heartburn due to stomach acid and contents returning to your esophagus.\n4. Hiatal hernia\nA hiatal hernia happens when part of your stomach gets pushed up toward your diaphragm through the hole that the esophagus passes through, which is called the hiatus.\nHiatal hernias don\u2019t always cause pain or discomfort. However, they may lead to acid reflux or GERD, which can cause epigastric pain or heartburn.\nLearn more about the symptoms of a hiatal hernia.\n5. Esophagitis\nEsophagitis occurs when the lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed.\nCommon causes include:\n\nacid coming back up from your stomach\nallergies\ninfection\nchronic irritation from medications\n\nRead about the symptoms of esophagitis.\n6. Gastritis\nGastritis happens when the lining of your stomach (mucosa) becomes inflamed. This may be due to a bacterial infection, an immune system disorder, or ongoing damage to your stomach.\nIt can be acute, last briefly, or chronic, lasting for years or more if left untreated.\nLearn more about the symptoms of gastritis.\n7. Peptic ulcer disease\nPeptic ulcer disease happens when the lining of your stomach or small intestine gets damaged a bacterial infection or by certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nLearn about other symptoms of peptic ulcer disease.\n8. Barrett\u2019s esophagus\nBarrett\u2019s esophagus occurs when the tissue that lines your esophagus becomes more like the tissue lining your intestines. This is known as intestinal metaplasia.\nThis condition may result from acid reflux, which can cause epigastric pain. However, not everyone with Barrett\u2019s esophagus will have acid reflux.\nIf you develop this condition, you\u2019ll need to work closely with your doctor to manage symptoms. Untreated Barrett\u2019s esophagus can increase your chances of cancer of the esophagus.\nLearn more about Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\n9. Gallbladder inflammation or gallstones\nYour gallbladder can become inflamed when gallstones block the opening of this organ. The condition is known as cholecystitis.\nThis can be painful and may require hospitalization or surgery.\nRead more about symptoms of gallbladder inflammation.\n10. Epigastric pain in pregnancy\nMild epigastric pain is common while you\u2019re pregnant due to the pressure on your abdominal area, as well as changes in your hormones, affecting digestion.\nHowever, significant epigastric pain in pregnancy is sometimes a symptom of a serious condition known as preeclampsia. You\u2019ll want to work closely with your doctor, as this can become life threatening if severe.\nLearn more about the symptoms of preeclampsia.\n11. Coronary artery disease\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), also called ischemic heart disease, can present with what may feel like gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain. This is particularly common in women.\nIf you have concerns that this may be the cause, it\u2019s important to seek advice from a doctor.\nRead about additional symptoms of coronary artery disease.\n12. Enlarged spleen\nThe spleen is a vital part of your immune system, located on the left side of your body beneath the rib cage. Various conditions or diseases can lead to an enlarged spleen.\nIf it isn\u2019t treated promptly, it can rupture, which can be life threatening.\nNot everyone with an enlarged spleen will experience symptoms, but it can feel like a pain in the abdomen where the spleen is located.\nLearn more about an enlarged spleen.\nHow do you get rid of upper epigastric pain?\n\nTreatment for epigastric pain depends on the cause. If your pain is from your diet or overeating, your doctor may recommend changing your eating habits or lifestyle. This may include taking regular exercise and eating nutrient-dense foods that don\u2019t upset your stomach.\nIf the pain is from certain medications, such as NSAIDs, your doctor may help you find another way to manage your pain. They may also suggest antacids or acid-blocking medications to relieve your symptoms.\nIf an underlying condition such as GERD, Barrett\u2019s esophagus, or peptic ulcer disease is causing your epigastric pain, you\u2019ll likely require acid-blocking medications. You may also require antibiotics if a bacterial infection is involved (for example, if your ulcer disease is due to H. pylori).\nWhen to contact a doctor\n\nReach out to your doctor immediately if your epigastric pain is severe, ongoing, or interfering with your daily life.\nSince there are life threatening conditions that can present with epigastric pain, such as CAD, it\u2019s important you go to the emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\ntrouble breathing or swallowing\nthrowing up blood\nblood in your stool or black, tarry stool\nhigh fever\nchest pain\ndifficulty breathing\npassing out\n\nYou should also contact your doctor if your symptoms do not improve with over-the-counter or home treatments and have lasted more than a few days.\nTakeaway\n\nEpigastric pain is a term used to describe pain or discomfort located beneath the ribcage in your upper abdomen. It can have various causes, many associated with the digestive system.\nEpigastric pain has a range of causes, some more severe than others. If your symptoms do not improve or you experience severe symptoms, contact a healthcare professional to find out the cause.\nContacting your doctor as soon as you notice persistent epigastric pain can help you find relief for your symptoms.\nHow we reviewed this article:\nSources\nHistory\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

The pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is complex, and the list of potential etiologies is vast. Patients with nausea and vomiting frequently report that eating exacerbates symptoms. Noteworthy gastrointestinal causes for meal-related nausea and vomiting include gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, dumping syndrome, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, and median arcuate ligament syndrome. A number of carefully selected diagnostic tests, utilization of the Rome criteria, and an appreciation for the epidemiology of these various conditions can help the clinician hone in on the underlying cause. Importantly, a properly performed and interpreted gastric emptying study is essential to making an accurate diagnosis of gastroparesis and distinguishing this condition from functional dyspepsia, a common disorder of gut-brain interaction. There are a number of treatment options for nausea and vomiting, and the treatment approach is dependent on the specific cause for the meal-related symptoms. This article examines the approach to meal-related nausea and vomiting by reviewing tests to consider in the diagnostic evaluation of symptoms, followed by a discussion of clinically relevant disorders and disorder-specific treatments.\n\nNausea and vomiting are common gastrointestinal symptoms that are nearly universally bothersome to the individuals affected and frequently lead to presentation to clinic, the emergency department, or hospitalization. The etiology of nausea and vomiting is complex and multifactorial, and can include both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal causes. In many cases, patients report that the act of eating will cause or exacerbate symptoms. Thus, the purpose of this article is to provide the clinician with a guide to approach meal-related nausea and vomiting specifically. After a review of epidemiology and pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting, common causes of meal-\u00adrelated symptoms will be examined and different treatments will be discussed. The goal of this article is not to provide a comprehensive review of nausea and vomiting, but rather a focused and practical guide for the common clinical scenario whereby symptoms of nausea and vomiting are strongly associated with eating.\n\nEpidemiology and Impact of Nausea and Vomiting\n\nAccurately characterizing the incidence and prevalence of nausea and vomiting is difficult, as these symptoms develop because of multiple etiologies. Persistent nausea and vomiting, regardless of the cause, are common symptoms requiring medical evaluation. Analysis of data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, as well as both the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, found that more than 5 million visits occur annually in the United States for symptoms of nausea and vomiting, making them the second most common gastrointestinal symptoms leading to an office or emergency department visit.1 In a telephone survey of 21,128 US adults, 7% reported nausea and vomiting in the prior 3 months.2 A population-based, cross-sectional telephone survey of 5000 Korean adults (age 20-60 years) found that nausea was present 1 day per week or more in 1.6%.3 Nearly 1 in 6 Americans have food poisoning each year, a common cause of acute nausea and vomiting.4\n\nThe impact of nausea and vomiting can be evaluated by reviewing the effects on quality of life for individuals and also by assessing the economic impact to the health care system. Recurrent nausea and vomiting, from any cause, can dramatically alter home, work, and social life. For example, women with hyperemesis gravidarum are 3 to 6 times more likely to report low health-related quality of life than women with less severe symptoms.5 Patients with celiac artery compression syndrome reported missing 22 days of school per year (adolescents) and 10 days of work per year (adults) owing to their symptoms.6 In a study of oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy, 90% reported that nausea and vomiting imposed a significant negative impact on daily functioning.7 Quality of life in patients with gastroparesis (GP) was significantly reduced and analogous to that of patients with chronic kidney disease and depression.8\n\nThe profound negative socioeconomic impact of nausea and vomiting has been measured in a number of studies. One investigation found that 8.6 million hours per year of paid employment in England and Wales are lost through pregnancy sickness symptoms, including nausea and vomiting.9 A Swedish study found that 28% of all sick leave is related to nausea of pregnancy.10 In the telephone survey of US adults noted previously, nausea and vomiting led to an average of 6.6 workdays, 9.0 leisure days, and 19.7 household days missed during the previous 3 months.2 A retrospective cohort study of 19,139 patients found that the estimated mean costs of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were $5299 for the first cycle of chemotherapy alone.11 Finally, the GP quality-of-life study found that symptoms of nausea and vomiting lowered annual income by 28.5% and resulted in disability in 11%, highlighting the negative impact of these symptoms on both patients and the health care system.8\n\nPathophysiology of Nausea and Vomiting\n\nNausea is a vague, unpleasant sense of unease with the feeling that vomiting might occur. Vomiting is the forceful ejection of gastric contents from the mouth. These 2 symptoms frequently coexist, although some patients vomit without preceding nausea. No single pathway or nucleus is responsible for symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Rather, multiple interrelated neural pathways, nuclei, and neurotransmitters (eg, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, substance P, neurokinin-1, cortisol, beta-endorphin, and vasopressin) are involved in the generation of these symptoms.12 This complex interplay helps to explain the diverse etiology of nausea and vomiting, and also clarifies why one treatment is unlikely to improve symptoms in all individuals. Symptoms of nausea and vomiting develop owing to stimulation of the emetic center (the vomiting center). This is a collection of closely linked nuclei located in the dorsolateral reticular formation of the medulla.13 Afferent pathways arise from the gastrointestinal tract, oropharynx, heart, musculoskeletal system, vestibular system, chemoreceptor trigger zone, and cerebral cortex. These pathways synapse on the solitary nucleus and then travel to the emetic center.14 It has been proposed that mild stimulation of these pathways leads to nausea, whereas more intense stimulation leads to vomiting. It is likely that differences in the degree of nausea and vomiting represent individual variations in sensory thresholds, which may reflect underlying traits of anxiety, anticipation, adaptation, and resilience, although this has not been formally tested. The physical act of vomiting involves a series of carefully orchestrated events involving descending (efferent) pathways and the gastrointestinal tract, diaphragm, abdominal wall muscles, and oropharynx.415,16 In brief, jejunal and duodenal retrograde contractions move material into the stomach, antral contractions stop and the stomach relaxes, pyloric tone increases, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes, abdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm contract, and material is propelled upward into the mouth to be ejected. During the final step, respiration briefly ceases, the glottis and vocal cords close, and the soft palate rises, all to prevent aspiration.14-16\n\nGastrointestinal causes of chronic nausea and vomiting include GP, cyclic vomiting syndrome, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, rapid gastric emptying, functional dyspepsia (FD), median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, peptic ulcer disease, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction.17 The pathophysiology of GP warrants mention, as it is a common reason for gastroenterology referral. Reduction in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal, injury to the enteric nervous system, nitric oxide dysregulation, vagal nerve injury, and alterations in the levels of gut hormones (eg, motilin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, gastrin, glucagon-like peptide [GLP]) may all contribute to the generation of gastric dysrhythmias, ineffective antral contractions, delayed gastric emptying, and resulting symptoms of nausea and vomiting.18-20 Although somewhat counterintuitive, rapid gastric emptying may also cause symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Impaired fundic accommodation (ie, after antireflux surgery), vagal nerve injury, medications, and abnormalities in hormones that impair gastric emptying (eg, glucagon, GLP-1, pancreatic polypeptide, amylin, leptin) may all contribute to the development of rapid gastric emptying.21\n\nDiagnostic Evaluation\n\nDiagnostic evaluation of meal-related nausea and vomiting encompasses a range of testing modalities aimed at identifying underlying abnormal gastrointestinal pathophysiology. The Figure contains a proposed diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of meal-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (Upper Endoscopy)\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is indicated in patients presenting with pertinent physical examination findings or alarm features such as recurrent vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, unintentional weight loss, or family history of inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy.22 Upper endoscopy allows for direct visualization of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa, enabling the identification of lesions and facilitating tissue biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis.23 Potential etiologies identified via EGD include peptic ulcer disease, gastric outlet obstruction, Helicobacter pylori infection, and celiac disease.17\n\nUpper Gastrointestinal Radiographic Series and Small Bowel Follow-Through\nUpper gastrointestinal radiographic series and small bowel follow-through are valuable in detecting mucosal lesions as well as SMA syndrome in patients with meal-related nausea and vomiting. Small bowel follow-through aids in identifying high-grade obstructions and can also provide information regarding small bowel transit time, contributing to the diagnostic workup.17,23\n\nMesenteric Ultrasound\nMesenteric ultrasound plays a role in identifying stenosis of the celiac artery, SMA, and inferior mesenteric artery by assessing the velocity of blood flow through the mesenteric vessels. Thus, mesenteric ultrasound is particularly useful in cases of suspected mesenteric ischemia or MALS and can be used as a screening tool, as it is safe, noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and generally well tolerated.24,25\n\nComputed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Enterography\nComputed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography is useful for identifying intestinal obstruction or strictures, which can be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or prior surgery or radiation. Additionally, CT or MR enterography may also detect extraluminal compression by abdominal or pelvic masses. MR imaging is preferred in younger patients or when repeat imaging is likely, owing to its lack of ionizing radiation.26\n\nGastric Emptying Scintigraphy\nGastric emptying scintigraphy (GES) remains the gold standard for assessing gastric emptying. This diagnostic method requires participants to consume a standardized meal (traditionally, 4 ounces of liquid egg whites infused with 0.5-1 mCi Technetium 99m sulfur colloid, 2 slices of white bread, 30 grams of strawberry jam, and water), ideally within 10 minutes.27 Following ingestion, patients undergo gastric scintigraphy, during which the residual volume of the meal within the stomach is measured through evaluation of anterior and posterior images at baseline, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours postprandially.27 Guidelines encourage a number of protocol measures that are essential to ensuring diagnostic accuracy, including conducting a full 4-hour scan, withholding opiates and other medications that influence the gastric emptying rate (ie, prokinetic and anticholinergic agents), and ensuring that blood glucose levels are controlled at the time of testing (fasting blood glucose <275 mg/dL).28 Failure to comply with these guidelines can lead to misdiagnosis of GP, as will be discussed in the following section.29,30\n\nSpecific Disorders and Treatments\n\nGastroparesis \nGP is defined by upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, early satiety, and/or bloating) in the setting of an objectively measured delay in gastric emptying and in the absence of mechanical obstruction.30 Because delayed gastric emptying is the defining feature of GP, the act of eating is inherently problematic for patients with this condition; as such, GP is frequently considered in the evaluation of meal-related nausea and vomiting. However, it is important to recognize that GP itself is relatively uncommon. A recent systematic review of 13 epidemiologic studies of patients with GP involving mostly US databases or registries identified a prevalence ranging from 13.8 to 267.7 per 100,000 adults.31 The etiology of GP is diverse, as the condition can occur as a complication of diabetes mellitus, surgery (eg, fundoplication, hiatal hernia repair, lung transplant), medications (eg, GLP-1 receptor agonists, opioids, anticholinergic agents), and ischemia as well as a variety of neurologic disorders, connective tissue disorders, and infections; GP can also be idiopathic in nature.32 Whereas idiopathic GP was once thought to be the most common presentation of GP, updated epidemiologic data suggest that the majority (57.4%) of patients with GP experience it as a complication of diabetes.33 The pathophysiology of GP is diverse and includes decreased gastric fundic tone, antroduodenal dyscoordination, gastric dysrhythmias, and abnormal duodenal feedback, as well as pyloric dysfunction in addition to delayed gastric emptying.34,35\n\nImportantly, GP cannot be diagnosed without objective findings of delayed gastric emptying, which is most commonly assessed by GES, as mentioned; gastric emptying can also be measured with a breath test using 13C-Spirulina.36 However, many centers do not adhere to national guidelines when conducting GES, which can lead to misdiagnosis.37 Updated guidelines by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) specify the importance of utilizing a solid meal to measure gastric emptying, ideally for 4 hours.30 Notably, a recent retrospective study involving 339 patients referred to a tertiary referral center for evaluation of GP found that 80.5% of patients ultimately received alternative diagnoses after tertiary evaluation.29 The lack of a properly performed gastric emptying study was identified as a significant factor leading to misdiagnosis of GP, as only 6.8% of patients were known to have undergone a 4-hour study that utilized a standard test meal of radiolabeled eggs.29 It should also be mentioned that while less than 90% gastric emptying (>10% retention) of a solid meal at the 4-hour mark on GES has traditionally been used as a cutoff to define GP, updated ACG guidelines suggest that this cutoff may need to be reconsidered, as mild delays in gastric emptying are commonly found in patients with FD, which will be discussed in the following section.30 In summary, proper performance and interpretation of GES is critical to making an accurate diagnosis of GP.\n\nTreatment of GP includes dietary therapy (frequent, small volume, low-fat, low-fiber meals; small particle diet), prokinetic therapy (eg, metoclopramide, domperidone, erythromycin, prucalopride), antiemetic therapy (eg, ondansetron, promethazine, aprepitant), behavioral therapy, and interventions such as gastric electrical stimulation and pyloromyotomy (see the Table for a list of disorder-specific treatments).30 Notably, only 1 medication (metoclopramide) is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of GP. However, a recently developed intervention, gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM), has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of GP and is becoming increasingly utilized in clinical practice, particularly in patients with medically refractory symptoms of nausea and vomiting related to GP.30,38 Importantly, data supporting G-POEM as a treatment for GP had historically involved only noncontrolled studies. However, a recent randomized, sham-controlled trial involving 41 patients with severe GP demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms and gastric emptying 6 months after G-POEM compared with a sham procedure for the first time.39 Although these results are encouraging, additional large sham-controlled trials, ideally with long-term follow-up, are still needed.\n\nFunctional Dyspepsia\nFD is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) characterized by symptoms of epigastric pain or pressure, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. The Rome IV criteria further categorize FD into 2 subgroups: epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS).40 Notably, FD patients with PDS, in particular, experience a significant relationship between eating and symptoms. Thus, in patients with meal-related nausea, FD should be a consideration, especially given its prevalence. In contrast with GP as described previously, the worldwide prevalence of FD has been estimated to be 7% to 10% and around 12% in the United States alone.41,42 The etiology of FD is diverse and incompletely understood. Psychological factors, medications (eg, anti-inflammatory agents), tobacco use, disturbances in the gut microbiome, female sex, and gastrointestinal infections (namely H pylori) have been identified as risk factors.43-45 The pathophysiology of FD is complex. Mild delays in gastric emptying, impaired gastric accommodation, visceral and central hypersensitivity, abnormal duodenogastric feedback, alterations in the microbiome, microscopic inflammation in the duodenum, and increased intestinal permeability have all been implicated as potential causative mechanisms.46-50 Furthermore, it should be mentioned that although GP and FD were once viewed as distinct disorders, there is a growing consensus among experts in the field that these disorders should be considered a part of the same spectrum of gastric sensorimotor dysfunction given that they share similar symptoms (ie, nausea, early satiety, abdominal pain), some pathophysiologic mechanisms (ie, mildly delayed gastric emptying in patients with FD), and some treatments (ie, prokinetics, antiemetics, neuromodulators).47,51 Additionally, in a recent trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium involving 944 patients, 42% of patients initially diagnosed with GP were found to have normal gastric emptying at the conclusion of the 48-week study, whereas 37% of patients with normal gastric emptying transitioned to a diagnosis of GP with findings of delayed gastric emptying at the conclusion of the study.51 The marked transition between diagnoses of GP and FD among patients in this landmark trial provides further evidence of the significant overlap that exists between these 2 disorders.\n\nFD can be diagnosed by using the Rome IV criteria to be certain that typical symptoms are present and by performing limited diagnostic tests (eg, upper endoscopy in appropriate patients) to help exclude an organic disorder.40,52 As mentioned, patients with the PDS subtype of FD report postprandial fullness and/or early satiation at least 3 days per week. Nausea can accompany symptoms of FD, but the presence of significant vomiting should prompt the clinician to consider other diagnoses. Notably, chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome (CNVS) is another DGBI that is characterized by nausea and/or vomiting at least once per week; a relative lack of abdominal pain, early satiety, and bloating help distinguish CNVS from FD.40 Additionally, a relationship between eating and symptoms is not required to make a diagnosis of CNVS; hence, this disorder will not be discussed at length in this article.\n\nTreatment of FD includes eradication of H pylori, proton pump inhibitor therapy, or treatment with tricyclic antidepressants or prokinetic agents.53 Other neuromodulators, such as mirtazapine and buspirone, are also used in practice, particularly for patients with meal-related symptoms.54-56 For patients who do not respond to drug therapy, guidelines recommend consideration of psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy.52 Virtual reality has also recently been shown to improve symptoms of FD in a small randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.57\n\nDumping Syndrome\nDumping syndrome (DS) presents with postprandial systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms, commonly following foregut surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vagotomy with pyloroplasty, sleeve gastrectomy, esophagectomy, and Nissen fundoplication.58,59 Gastrointestinal symptoms include borborygmi, epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea, whereas systemic symptoms include heart palpitations, tachycardia, fatigue, flushing, pallor, lightheadedness, the urge to lie down, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. These symptoms arise from rapid fluid shifts owing to food osmolality, resulting from accelerated transit of ingested contents to the small intestine, leading to abdominal bloating, distension, hyperinsulinemia mediated by exaggerated GLP-1 response, and release of vasoactive gastrointestinal hormones.59\n\nEarly DS typically occurs 1 hour postprandially, whereas late DS occurs 1 to 3 hours after meal ingestion.58-62 The modified oral glucose tolerance test aids diagnosis, identifying early DS by heart rate elevation over 10 bpm or 3% hematocrit rise within 30 minutes postprandially, and late DS by postprandial hypoglycemia. Combining oral glucose tolerance test and validated questionnaires such as the Sigstad Score and Arts Dumping Questionnaire enhances diagnostic sensitivity.59,63 Initial DS treatment involves dietary modifications with small, frequent meals, avoiding simple carbohydrates and premeal liquids. Acarbose can prevent carbohydrate cleavage in refractory cases.59,60,62 Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide reduce splanchnic vasodilation in patients unresponsive to diet and acarbose.62,64 Surgical or endoscopic revisions, such as transoral outlet reduction post\u2013Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, may be necessary if pharmacologic interventions fail.65-67\n\nSuperior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome\nSMA syndrome, first described in 1842 by von Rokitansky and characterized in 1927 by Wilkie, presents as a rare cause of meal-related nausea and vomiting.68,69 It occurs when the third part of the duodenum is compressed externally between an acute angle formed by the SMA and the aorta. This compression obstructs duodenal transit, leading to postprandial symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, distension, and epigastric pain; symptoms can frequently be alleviated by bending forward or lying in a knee-to-chest position.70 The vascular angle change typically follows rapid weight loss, reducing retroperitoneal fat that normally separates the SMA and aorta. This change can then perpetuate symptoms, leading to further weight loss and exacerbation of SMA syndrome.70,71 Diagnosis of SMA syndrome is based on symptoms and radiologic evidence of duodenal obstruction by the SMA. This can be assessed with an upper gastrointestinal radiographic series showing an abrupt compression of the third portion of the duodenum with resulting dilation of the proximal duodenum, with or without gastric dilation.70 Historically, CT angiography has been considered the standard to diagnose SMA syndrome, as this modality can assess the aortomesenteric angle (normal >25 degrees) and distance (normal >8 mm), as well as detect evidence of duodenal obstruction.70-73 Similar to CT angiography, MR angiography can also be performed, and mesenteric ultrasound has recently emerged as a modality for measuring the aortomesenteric distance with sensitivity similar to CT.74 Initial management includes gastric decompression and enteral or parenteral nutrition to rebuild retroperitoneal fat.75 Gastrojejunostomy is considered if conservative measures fail.76\n\nMedian Arcuate Ligament Syndrome\nArising anteriorly from the aorta, the celiac artery passes through the diaphragm at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. The artery lies underneath the median arcuate ligament; this connects the 2 medial borders of the diaphragm and is surrounded by the celiac plexus and the celiac ganglia. If the median arcuate ligament is displaced inferiorly or if the celiac artery is displaced superiorly from its typical position, compression of the artery may occur, leading to symptoms labeled MALS. First reported in 1965,77 celiac artery compression may lead to symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Symptoms may worsen during expiration as the diaphragm moves upward, stretching the diaphragmatic crura, and exacerbating compression of the artery. Physical examination may reveal tenderness in the right upper quadrant, whereas auscultation in a quiet room may uncover a bruit or thrill. The diagnosis of this uncommon disorder is controversial, in part because compression of the celiac artery has been identified in more than 10% of an asymptomatic population.78 Symptomatic celiac artery compression (MALS) is more commonly identified in thin women between the ages of 30 and 50 years.79 Anatomic/structural causes should be ruled out by EGD; hepatobiliary causes can be excluded with appropriate laboratory tests and an ultrasound. GES can identify delayed gastric emptying. In the appropriate patient, a mesenteric ultrasound should be the first test performed, as it is safe, noninvasive, and has high yield.80 An expiratory peak velocity of greater than 200 cm/s supports the diagnosis of MALS.81 However, this needs to be confirmed with either a CT angiogram or MR angiogram. In many centers, a definitive diagnosis is made with an angiogram and provocative maneuvers (eg, injection of papaverine, celiac blockade). Treatment involves laparoscopic surgical release of the median arcuate ligament; concomitant celiac plexus neurolysis is often performed. Fifty percent to 80% of patients note an improvement in symptoms.82,83\nConclusion\n\nNausea and vomiting are common, bothersome symptoms that frequently lead to evaluation in the clinic and hospital setting. The differential diagnosis for nausea and vomiting is vast, and it is often helpful to first separate gastrointestinal causes from nongastrointestinal ones. Because eating can be a trigger for symptoms, it is also helpful for the clinician to recognize and understand the conditions associated with meal-related nausea and vomiting specifically, including GP, FD, DS, SMA syndrome, and MALS. These conditions can often be distinguished by differences in presentation and results of diagnostic testing. A careful selection of diagnostic tests, utilization of the Rome criteria (to make an accurate diagnosis of DGBIs such as FD), and an appreciation for the epidemiology of the aforementioned conditions can further aid the clinician in making an accurate diagnosis. Notably, if GES is performed, it is important to do so according to guidelines and to interpret the results properly to make an accurate diagnosis of GP as well as to distinguish the condition from FD. Fortunately, there are a number of medications and interventions for nausea and vomiting within the treatment armamentarium, and it is important for the clinician to select an appropriate treatment based on the specific cause for the patient\u2019s meal-related symptoms.\n\nDisclosures\nThe authors have no relevant conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\u00a0Peery AF, Crockett SD, Murphy CC, et al.

Epigastric pain is pain that occurs in the upper abdomen, which is the area just beneath your ribs.\n\nIt\u2019s common for people to experience epigastric pain while they are eating or directly after eating. It can range in severity from mild discomfort to an extremely painful burning sensation.\n\nEpigastric pain can come with many other digestive symptoms, including constipation, diarrhea, and bloating.\n\n10 Causes of Epigastric Pain\n\nSo if epigastric pain is so common, what\u2019s causing it?\n\nThe truth is, there are many possible causes of epigastric pain. Epigastric pain can be attributed to anything from trivial health issues to serious diseases. Many different health issues can contribute to epigastric pain. Here are 10 common epigastric pain causes:\n\n1. Acid reflux: Acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) cause stomach acid to flow upwards into your esophagus (which is the tube that connects your stomach and throat). This causes epigastric pain, particularly when laying down after eating a meal. While anyone can experience occasional acid reflux, GERD is a chronic disease that requires treatment.\n\n2. Gastritis: Gastritis refers to inflammation of the lining of the stomach. This can be temporary, often due to infections or other triggers, or it can be a chronic condition.\n\n3. Heartburn and indigestion: Similar to acid reflux, indigestion occurs when your stomach produces an excessive amount of acid that flows up into your esophagus. This commonly causes heartburn, which is a burning sensation in your chest. However, it also typically causes epigastric pain. Indigestion can be either temporary or a repeated occurrence.\n\n4. Pregnancy: Pregnancy can bring a wide range of health issues with it, and one of those is epigastric pain. Pregnant women have more pressure on their abdominal walls, which can cause pain. Hormone fluctuations can lead to issues with digestion that cause acid reflux and other conditions associated with epigastric pain.\n\n5. Alcohol consumption: While most people know the harmful effects of alcohol, few realize that drinking alcohol is also a cause of epigastric pain. Alcohol can irritate or damage the lining of your stomach, which can result in inflammation.\n\n6. Overeating: Eating too much can lead to epigastric pain. Like with pregnancy, although to a lesser extent, excessive eating can put pressure on your abdominal wall. It can also lead to indigestion. It is common for people to experience pain after eating too much. Luckily, overeating can easily be corrected.\n\n7. Lactose intolerance: Lactose intolerance is a condition where your body cannot properly digest lactose, which is found in dairy products. One of the most common symptoms of lactose intolerance is epigastric pain. As well, other food allergies or sensitivities could potentially trigger epigastric pain if you have trouble digesting them properly.\n\n8. Stomach cancer: While many causes of epigastric pain are innocuous, it can also be a sign of a serious condition like stomach cancer, as well as pancreatic cancer. One of the first signs of cancer is the sudden onset of unexplained pain.\n\n9. Gall bladder infections and gallstones: Any condition that affects your gallbladder can also cause epigastric pain. Typically these types of conditions cause pain on your lower right side, but that pain can spread up to your upper abdomen.\n\n10. Peptic ulcer disease: One of the most common causes of epigastric pain is peptic ulcer disease (PUD). In this condition, an ulcer or sore forms in your stomach or small intestine.\n\nWhile these are 10 of the most frequent causes of epigastric pain, there are many more potential conditions that can lead to this type of pain. Hernias, bacterial infections, diseases (including cardiac disease), and side effects of medications can all play a part in epigastric pain.\n\nDiagnosing Causes of Epigastric Pain\n\nWith all the potential causes of epigastric pain, how are you supposed to determine which one is contributing to your pain?\n\nThe only way to accurately determine what is the cause of your specific pain is to see a doctor or a medical professional who can conduct a thorough medical examination and order tests. With so many potential causes, it is vital to see a doctor. While your pain could be due to something as simple as overeating, it could also be the first signs of stomach cancer.\n\nYour physician may have to conduct tests to determine what\u2019s causing your pain. This could include a blood test, urinalysis test, or a test to identify inflammation in your body.\n\nSymptoms of Epigastric Pain\n\nEpigastric pain does not only hurt, but it can also bring about a range of other symptoms with it. Depending on what\u2019s causing your pain, you could experience many other digestive symptoms too, such as bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea. If this is a one-time occurrence, it may simply resolve on its own, but repeated occurrences need medical treatment.\n\nMore extreme symptoms can include weight loss and vomiting. When this occurs, they could be signs of more serious conditions that should be evaluated by a physician.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that epigastric pain is not always limited to your upper abdomen. The pain can radiate up to your chest, neck and back. If you\u2019re experiencing excessive pain throughout your entire upper body, it could be due to something like gastritis or acid reflux. However, only a doctor would be able to diagnosis the cause.\n\nTreatment of Epigastric Pain\n\nTreatment of epigastric pain depends entirely on what is causing it. For pain that occurs because of overeating, alcohol consumption, or food triggers, nothing more than lifestyle changes are typically necessary. By stopping the behavior that causes the pain, your pain will resolve itself.\n\nFor serious conditions, such as diseases or cancers, the underlying cause has to be treated.\n\nCurrently, there are some medications that can reduce epigastric pain. Anti-inflammatory medications can help calm inflammation, while antacids and other treatments can reduce the amount of stomach acid you are producing.\n\nHowever, many natural treatment options are also effective. There are a wide range of natural remedies that can soothe your stomach and improve your digestion. Cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and lemon juice all help secrete digestive juices in your stomach. Having a warm glass of lemon juice and a couple of tablespoons of cumin seeds before a meal will help prevent any pain from developing. After a meal, eat half a teaspoon of fennel seeds, unless you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nEpigastric pain is an uncomfortable but common condition for many people. There are a large number of health conditions that can contribute to it. While many of the causes are not concerning, it is still best to see a doctor to rule out serious disorders. Most of the time, you don\u2019t have to worry and your pain will resolve on its own.\n\nHowever, even if epigastric pain is not caused by something serious, it\u2019s still best to get it treated. Your quality of life can greatly improve without having to deal with pain whenever you eat a meal.\n\nRead More:\n\nSources for Today\u2019s Article:\n \u201cEpigastric Pain: What Can Cause Pain in Epigastric Region,\u201d ePainAssist web site, http://www.epainassist.com/abdominal-pain/epigastric-pain, last accessed November 30, 2015.\n \u201cEpigastric Pain Causes,\u201d Healthgrades web site, http://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/digestive-health/epigastric-pain\u2013causes, last accessed November 30, 2015.\n \u201cEpigastric Pain (Uncertain Cause),\u201d University of Minnesota Medical Center web site, http://www.uofmmedicalcenter.org/healthlibrary/Article/116731EN, last accessed November 30, 2015.\n \u201cEverything You Need to Know About the Epigastric Pain And Treatment Methods,\u201d TreatEpigastricPain.com, http://treatepigastricpain.com/, last accessed November 30, 2015.\n\nFrom Around the Web\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nABOUT DOCTORS HEALTH PRESS\n\nHEALTHY LIVING\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n",
